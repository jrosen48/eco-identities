general,Land can support | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2194/land-can-support,663,1,1,N0iz,"TL;DR: ""Land can support: x"" for plant A means ""Current 4x4 cell can continuously support x A without fertilizers or water added"" Hey, I think I know what the ""Land can support"" number means and since a quick search showed no info on that on the forum and wiki there goes this post.. From basic experiments with corn seeds, a soil sampler and and a bit of land I gathered that: -> There is a ""soil state"" grid with 4x4 cells (so not aligned to the claim grid).
-> Farming variables (nutrients, temperature, rain, etc) are uniform across those 4x4 cells I think that: ~> The ""Land can support"" value for a particular plant is the number of plant you can farm renewably on this 4x4 cell without depleting the nutrients and hence use fertilizers. So a ""land can suppport"" of 16 (4x4) or more is a perfect value. (I hope this is not viewed as spoilers and that I'm not misinforming)",text5939,1,0.9623149381674516

Game.eco is a compressed file and you do need to use winzip, but all the configuration files also use the .eco extension and are not compresses (zipped) files.  They are actually just text files.  Associating .eco with winrar or winzip will then cause issues if you go to open a configuration file - and winzip tried to open a  text file. My advise is to skip the step associating .eco to winzip or winrar - it will not keep you from using them for opening (extracting) Game.eco you just have to select winrar or winzip (or 7z for that matter) as the tool to use to extract game.eco.",text1544,2,0.9825932774323041

Anh mang trong mình hai dòng máu: cha người Đức, mẹ người Sierra Leone. Rudiger luôn cảm thấy có chút khác biệt so với các đồng hương người Đức, thậm chí tới mức còn hơn cả khi anh chuyển đến Italy năm 2015 (gia nhập AS Roma từ Stuttgart). Anh nhận thấy những người địa phương ở Rome đã hoan nghênh sự có mặt của anh hơn ở quê nhà. “Ở Đức, không chỉ thời tiết lạnh, hầu hết mọi người cũng rất lạnh nhạt với nhau"", Rudiger nhận xét. Xem thêm: Kết quả bóng đá hôm nay Rudiger hoàn tất vụ chuyển nhượng đến Chelsea hôm 9/7. Tuy nhiên, khác với suy nghĩ ban đầu của anh, tại Italy anh đã phải trải nghiệm cái gọi là mặt tối hơn của nhân loại. Ngày 4/12/2016, Rudiger góp công giúp Roma đánh bại địch thủ cùng thành phố là Lazio với kết quả 2-0 trên sân Olimpico. Danilo Cataldi bị truất quyền thi đấu, nhưng đồng đội của tiền vệ này tại Lazio là Senad Lulic trở thành tâm điểm của sự chú ý với những lời bình luận gây tranh cãi sau trận đấu. “Rudiger đã kích động chúng tôi ngay từ trước khi trận đấu diễn ra”, cầu thủ người Bosnia phát biểu. “Hai năm trước, anh ta ở Stuttgart, còn bán tất và thắt lưng. Còn bây giờ anh ta hành động cứ như thể anh ta là một hiện tượng”. Xem thêm: lịch thi đấu bóng đá Thái độ phân biệt chủng tộc trong trường hợp này được cho là rất rõ ràng. Nhưng Lulic chỉ bị Liên đoàn bóng đá Italy (FIGC) treo giò một trận vì lỗi phát ngôn xúc phạm người khác. Rudiger sau đó đã mạnh mẽ lên tiếng về tình trạng phân biệt chủng tộc nghiêm trọng ở bóng đá Italy, sau khi xảy ra thêm hai vụ liên quan tới tiền vệ Sulley Muntari (người Ghana) và trung vệ Medhi Benatia (Marốc). “Tôi phải nghiêm túc nói ra vấn đề này, bởi vì tôi không thể và không được phép bỏ qua một điều gì đó kiểu như thế. Tôi cũng là một phần của vấn nạn này. Phân biệt chủng tộc là một vấn đề nghiêm trọng ở đây, Italy”, Rudiger trả lời tờ Bild hồi tháng Năm. “Khi FIGC không làm bất cứ điều gì để giải quyết, thì FIFA phải hành động. Thật dễ dàng để đặt ra chiến dịch ‘Nói không với phân biệt chủng tộc’, nhưng khi bạn không làm bất cứ điều gì cụ thể, thì chiến dịch đó chẳng có ý nghĩa gì”. Về chuyên môn, Rudiger đã lớn lên cùng với sự ngưỡng mộ ban đầu dành cho thần tượng Thierry Henry, và anh cũng từng chơi ở tuyến trên khi còn là cầu thủ nhí. Tuy nhiên, sau khi được Borussia Dortmund tuyển mộ hồi còn là cầu thủ thiếu niên, Rudiger đã được đào tạo để dần phát triển thành một trung vệ. Những người hùng mới của cầu thủ này là các hậu vệ huyền thoại người Italy gồm Paolo Maldini, Alessando Nesta và Fabio Cannavaro. Dortmund có danh tiếng tuyệt vời về nuôi dưỡng tài năng trẻ. Nhưng Rudiger cảm thấy anh đã có tương lai tốt hơn sau khi rời Dortmund đến với Stuttgart. “Kể từ sau khi Mario Gotze từ tuyến trẻ giành được chỗ ở đội một, chỉ có thêm hai cầu thủ khác làm được điều tương tự ở Dortmund. Trong khi đó, tại Stuttgart, tôi đã chơi tới hơn 80 trận cùng đội một. Vì vậy tôi nghĩ tôi đã lựa chọn đúng khi chia tay Dortmund để gia nhập Stuttgart”. Thực ra, ngay từ khi còn thi đấu cho Stuttgart, Rudiger đã thu hút sự chú ý của một số CLB hàng đầu châu Âu, trong đó có Liverpool. Nhưng anh cuối cùng quyết định chuyển đến Roma, với hy vọng được tham dự Champions League. Anh gặp rắc rối vì vấn đề đầu gối ở giai đoạn đầu của mùa giải ra mắt Roma, nhưng sau đó đã nỗ lực giành được vị trí trong đội hình xuất phát. Nhưng phong độ của anh hồi ấy vẫn còn thất thường. Anh còn bị đánh giá là mẫu hậu vệ dễ mắc lỗi và kỷ luật kém. Chính Rudiger cũng thừa nhận điều đó khi nhớ lại: “Một hay hai trận tốt thì lại đến một trận tồi”. Nhưng HLV trưởng tuyển Đức Joachim Low đánh giá Rudiger rất cao, thậm chí so sánh anh với Jerome Boateng. Rudiger lẽ ra đã có tên trong đội hình tham dự Euro 2016 nếu không bị chấn thương. Tương lai của Rudiger đang rất xạn lạn, nhất là sau khi chuyển đến Chelsea. Chấn thương dây chằng chéo đầu gối mà Rudiger gặp phải khi tập luyện vào tối trước giải đấu lớn đầu tiên của anh hồi đó cũng khiến trung vệ này không thể cập bến Chelsea ngay từ hè năm ngoái. Sau đó, anh ký hợp đồng dài hạn với Roma, và chơi ngày càng tốt hơn sau khi hoàn toàn bình phục thể lực. “Khi tôi trở lại sân đấu, họ nói với tôi rằng dường như tôi chưa bao giờ bị chấn thương”, Rudiger cho biết. Rudiger ngày càng khiến các tiền đạo gặp khó khăn hơn khi đối mặt. Tại Serie A, anh chơi tốt cả khi đảm nhận vị trí hậu vệ phải hay trung vệ. Anh cũng phát huy khả năng khi được bố trí ở bên trái hàng hậu vệ ba người của tuyển Đức tại Confederations Cup mới kết thúc. Rudiger không chỉ ngăn chặn các tiền đạo, mà còn đeo bám tốt các cầu thủ chạy cánh của đối phương. Về mặt thể chất, Rudiger là mẫu cầu thủ đáp ứng được những đòi hỏi của giải Ngoại hạng Anh, trong đó có sức mạnh và tốc độ. Chiều cao 1,9 mét còn giúp anh là cầu thủ đáng gờm trong các tình huống không chiến phổ biến ở bóng đá Anh. HLV Antonio Conte được cho là nhân vật chính thúc đẩy vụ chuyển nhượng Rudiger tới Stamford Bridge. “Tất cả những gì tôi có thể nói là Conte là một HLV tuyệt vời"", Rudiger nói thêm. Người hâm mộ Chelsea dường như vẫn còn cảm thấy bất ngờ với sự xuất hiện của Rudiger. “Nhưng anh sẽ chứng minh được giá trị xuất sắc, vì có khả năng chơi ở bất kỳ đâu nơi hàng phòng ngự, phù hợp với cả hàng hậu vệ ba hay năm người”, tờ Goal nhận định. Rudiger đầu quân cho Chelsea sau khi vừa cùng tuyển Đức vô địch Confederations Cup 2017 trên đất Nga. Anh đã có tất cả 17 trận khoác áo tuyển quốc gia từ năm 2014 đến nay.

general,What's the value in cooking? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4962/what-s-the-value-in-cooking,569,3,2,jacqhammer,"there are two answers to that the short and the long. the short answer is SP gain, you get higher SP gain from high level foods then you do from lower level foods. the long answer is finding the best SP gain for the food you are making. From what I have found is that adv campfire is only going to give you around 55 food SP where home cooking is going to give you 85 food SP and adv cooking is going to give you around 120 food SP. The reason behind this is how food SP is calculated. you have your 4 food value categorizes, carbs, protein, fat and vitamins. Adv campfire foods are going to max around 12 for any given value. like chard meat is like 10 fat and 12 protein but 0 carbs and 0 vitamins. when you balance that out with a food that has carbs and vitamins you are going to create a new value. when you take all 4 values and ad the multiplier you get your final food SP value. the multiplier raises from 1.1 to 2.0 based on how close your 4 values are to each other. example if each of you 4 values is 10 then you multiplier will be x2. but if you have 3 values at 8 and 1 at 10 your going to have a x1.6. so when you eat adv campfire food your 4 base value are going to only be around 8 to giving you a food SP gain of around 55. with home cooking you can get around 9 so you get 85 food SP. and with adv cooking you'll have 15 for a food SP of 120. yes you need a lot of crops to make more adv foods. but not all foods are equal. so you have to look at the values you are going to eat. like with home cooking. ppl assume that veg soup and skimmed meat will give the highest SP gain, but reality is that basic salads and crispy bacon will give you the best overall value for home cooking. With adv cooking if you eat bear supreme and sweet salads you'll get around 12o food SP. Honestly most of the foods you can cook are worthless, like stuffed turkey. I hope that helps answer your question. I apologize for the long explanation, but its very complex system that can't be correctly answered with a one liner.",text4337,10,0.994213109561942

The 'message' of this game is that everyone is important in a society, and change cannot happen unless everyone is brought-along in greater wisdom and knowledge.   Everyone does contribute to pollution and systems of environmental abuse, inasmuch as they are complicit in consuming the products which come from those activities.   Corporations are only providing services which are in-demand by the populace.   Stop the demand, and you stop the cause of the unsustainable behaviors.   Legislation can help, but ultimately it is education for all which is going to change the World...",text5330,11,0.9550305557290373

The issue you mentioned is solved by having faction-less players follow ALL laws of all factions. Where two different laws clash, the more strict of the two laws is enforced. It's not realistic, but it does prevent griefing. Exactly. There's also the issue of carebearism - where players won't engage in PvP regardless of any advantage.

has been changed to 1600, since Gold is 2.45 times denser than Iron. -Copper Ingot
has been changed to 1700, since Copper is a little denser than Iron. -Gold Tailings
have been reduced to 1 Since the gold tailing solid/Liquid Ratio is 40:60 and 1MT of mined Ore generates 2.49 MT of Tailing. -Iron Tailings
have been reduced to 1 to match the cleaner processing and reflect the re-processing of iron tailing (e.g.cement) -Copper Tailings
