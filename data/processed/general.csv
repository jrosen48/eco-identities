I noticed that a lot of the notes from the update is going to change the game world and somewhat drastically effect the world as a whole. As such, are we going to have to generate a new world to play on? Also, another question. Is it possible to generate a world bigger than 400x400?"
general,Upcoming Update - Question | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5230/upcoming-update-question,66,2,2,SLG-Dennis,"We strongly recommend to generate a new world, converting might be possible for some worlds, but could cause major issues for others. In any case you won't have the new features of biomes. 400x400 is already deemed totally unstable by us, so we won't recommend using any higher numbers either - you would need to try yourself. We strongly recommend to not go over 200x200. Anything above might cause big lag or weird behaviours."

general,Overhauling the Farming system | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4993/overhauling-the-farming-system,910,4,1,jacqhammer,"I'm putting this post up here for players to add to the idea of overhauling the whole farming system for the game devs. So if you have any input you would like to add feel free. I'm curious to see what players think and have experienced with the whole farming system. I have been farming in Eco since I bought the game on steam back in February. Honestly it took me about 2 weeks to master the system and even after all this time I still have huge frustrations with how the system works. To start I 'm going to review how the current system works. The farming system is not the same as the farming skill. The farming system is the complex system of world gen, NPK values and land movement. For anyone that has been a farmer you know that setting up a large farm is dependent on the RL players understanding of of the game mechanics and not the skills that a character has through skill points. If your not familer with all the little small changes that effect farming look it up on the wiki. Honestly there is about 15 different game mechanic factors that effect farming which make a very complex system to grow food. So if you don't know how it works look it up, you will be very surprised. What I'm proposing is for the devs to create a new system for farming while still keeping the old system. Right now when a world begins only about 15% of the world is capable of high food out put. The reason behind this is the how biomes are created and the values plants need to grow. those two combined limit where farmers can set up and grow crops. Most of the worlds i've been in I have found I need to be very far outside of town to grow food. The reason is how land values change. I once had a massive corn field that died overnight because someone built a house next to my property. Surprised? So was I, but the just the function of building a small house created a cascade effect that kill off over 16 5x5 plots of corn. Why? because when they build the house it decreased the moisture value and temperature value of the land around it. in turn that effected my crops and lowered the moisture and temperature of my corn fields. all it took was a 3 degree drop in temperature and a 5% change in moisture to turn all my crops from 100% match to a 0% match in less then a few hours. the effect was I was out 400 corn seeds and had 16 plots of land I couldn't use to grow crops. Doesn't seem right that a farmer has to move there farm every time someone builds a house next to their fields. But based on how the game mechanics works this is a problem. This is only one of many small factors that can ruin a farm. there are more. So how can this be corrected? I suggest having fertile plots for farming. for example a 5x5 item that farmers can make that allows them to control the crops they are growing. It doesn't make sense that we can build laser to shot down a meteor but have no idea on how to control the growth of plants. by having a controllable farm plot a farmer is no longer dependent on the changes in land, world gen or world ticks to grow crops. Right now growing crops does depend on server ticks. Just because your plant says it will take 19.5 hours doesn't mean it will. Due to high population servers world ticks take longer and longer. I've had times where crops take up to 48 hours to grow because the world ticks take longer and longer. Imagine trying to feed 10 players with your crops and you need to produce at least 100 raw produce for each player every 24 hours to feed them. Basic math will tell you that you need to grow 1000 plants to maintain the minimum required food. As a farmer you know that 1 5x5 land plot will produce 25-75 produce times the gathering skill you have. the avg 5x5 plot will produce 4 produce per block, so the math is 25x4= 200 or 1 5x5 plot makes 200 produce. So you will need at least 5 5x5 plots to produce the food for players. in reality you need  a lot more food then 100 raw crops per player the real number is closer to 1000. but you take other factors in to consideration, like distance of your farm to other players and how many cals a player is using in a given 24 hour period, ect. problems like low yields and increased grow times are going to cause massive issues for players. So but putting in player controllable farms would allow players to farm closer to large cities, control production values and production times. it could be as simple as creating a single block that you can grow a type of produce on that is not effected by world gen or land values to a complex hydroponic item that function like a crafting type. in any case I think the game is getting to a point where controlled farming is needed. I also think that gathering, farming, fertilizers and digging should all be combined into one skill. Each skill by itself has very limited value to game play, by combining them into 1 skill the player is better equipped to do their job. I have other ideas like making food have a freshness timer so that after a given amount of time food rots. That alone would help driven the food economy. That would also push to have iceboxes and fridges used to keep food fresh. But if any farmers have any ideas that would work to help overhaul the farming system, add to this post. lets put together a complete player driven idea to support the devs in building a new farming system."
general,Overhauling the Farming system | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4993/overhauling-the-farming-system,910,4,2,Melborne,"Well put. In most servers, you can go around and ask; Most laborers such as Miners, or Lumberjacks will tell you that they usually forage for food to keep up with the demands of a server for their profession. Even with 5-10 players, at least half of them will catch and consume charred fish for calories alone, regardless of their skill point gain or profession. Later on, when their role is maxed, they'll turn to food production for better rates/quality for themselves. And in turn, become less dependant on the food production roles in the world. Aka the Farmer. I've played for many, many years, and farming/food production has been my favorite role. In fact one I've only played willingly. Food runs the server, without it, you can't play/do things. It's impossible for one person to feed many, with multiple farmers sure.. you can grow/harvest/forage enough food for a group but in no way is it quality food. A while back the Farming/Crop system completely changed to what it is today, and it completely stunted the Farmer and his/her crops. In my honest opinion, the change is bullshit. I've even commented on it once awhile back on the forums here, how I find it utterly nonsense that a Farmer cannot plant a 20x30 field without 1/3rd+ of his crops dying because they're overcrowded. If the game was trying to go for an Eco-Realism, the human population would have died out by now based on these rules. Obviously none of the developers have a green thumb, let alone a history of even putting a seed in dirt before, or dare I say... seen a farm. I grew up with fields of wheat, corn and beets around me. As far as the eye can see. Overcrowding doesn't kill a plant. It stunts the quantity. I encourage our devs to plant 2 rows of vegetables in their office, literally any. Corn, Beets, Carrots, Anything. Buy a grow lamp off Amazon, it's like 50 bucks. One row, plant the 10-20 seeds as directed in length/depth by the package, and the second row.. plant them a little closer together, so 15-25 seeds. Now you can go ahead, and do this, wait the 30-65 days depending on the seed, and show us your findings. Because this system is rubbish. The idea behind the new system is that you use a world-layer to find a population-viable plot of land for a plant. Currently, I live in a good spot for Beets and Wheat. So you till the land, fertilize it if need be, and plop your seed in the dirt. Wait a day, and harvest. Crop rotation is certainly needed unless you plan on fertilizing before every crop, then repeat. Seems simple enough, as long as you find the right plot of land. But, if you plant too many.. Your crops become overcrowded, and die. So even if you have PERFECT land for Wheat, it still dies. Funny, it's perfect for wheat.. each block, 20 long by 30 wide, but not perfect enough to actually grow your crops. This doesn't make sense. Again, over population might effect your Aerogarden, but not when each block is 1 meter squared. 1 Meter of ground is more than enough to grow 1 wheat seed. In fact, you could throw in 8 more seeds in that block and still have a good harvest depending on your weather. 1 Block, 1 Meter squared, 1 seed directly in the middle of that block. That means the next seed is 1 meter away... yet, it becomes over crowded. 0/10 As for what the OP said, about small backyard farm plots 5x5, and people building next to you.. I don't think the system works very well for players building a farm in a town."

I played the game half a year ago, and there was no problem burrying half a full 5x5x5 stockpile 10-20 tiles below the ground. But now? First of all, we currently have around 30-40 stockpiles at deepest Level (~7-8) :D... But we see no chance in stopping the pollution at ground level (~50).
In the worldmap, everything is 'white'. Using the soilsampler we see pollution levels at around 400-6000% (of what? :) ).
It's just marginally higher undergroud, maybe even the same. Is this intentionally from the game devs?
Maybe they want us to have pure industrial areas around the world? Or is there a serious way to stop these large amounts of tailings polluting our city? It would be really useful to have the actual formula (how pollution spreads) :D We think about dividing our stockpiles to a larger area, because smaller amounts don't seem to do much harm to the environment on top. Before we invest too much time in this, has anyone recently played with larger amounts of tailings? And found a way to store them correctly? Thanks in advance, you might save our planet ;) Edit: I got some information on the eco discord server:
Someone sugested to place tailings under the deepest mountain with low rainfall and moisture levels. Our initial place I mentioned above has pretty high moisture levels. Maybe thats why we are experiencing that immense spread of pollution."

Adv campfire foods are going to max around 12 for any given value. like chard meat is like 10 fat and 12 protein but 0 carbs and 0 vitamins. when you balance that out with a food that has carbs and vitamins you are going to create a new value. when you take all 4 values and ad the multiplier you get your final food SP value. the multiplier raises from 1.1 to 2.0 based on how close your 4 values are to each other. example if each of you 4 values is 10 then you multiplier will be x2. but if you have 3 values at 8 and 1 at 10 your going to have a x1.6. so when you eat adv campfire food your 4 base value are going to only be around 8 to giving you a food SP gain of around 55. with home cooking you can get around 9 so you get 85 food SP. and with adv cooking you'll have 15 for a food SP of 120. yes you need a lot of crops to make more adv foods. but not all foods are equal. so you have to look at the values you are going to eat. like with home cooking. ppl assume that veg soup and skimmed meat will give the highest SP gain, but reality is that basic salads and crispy bacon will give you the best overall value for home cooking. With adv cooking if you eat bear supreme and sweet salads you'll get around 12o food SP. Honestly most of the foods you can cook are worthless, like stuffed turkey. I hope that helps answer your question. I apologize for the long explanation, but its very complex system that can't be correctly answered with a one liner."

So to find out how many logs I need with efficiency 5 if the original is 10 I do this: =(10-10*$D$13) so, we take the original quantity, 10 and multiply it by the D13 cell. Make sure to include the $ signs, because this tells google sheets to always use that specific square even if you paste this formula somehwere else. Just update that number to whatever efficiency skill is represented. 10 * D13 will get us the percentage of items we are saving, so we subtract that from our original amount of 10. Maybe not the best formula, and please let me know if I can improve, but it should help some people out to make dynamic spreadsheets."

general,Stone vs Wood: propper balanced? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4729/stone-vs-wood-propper-balanced,667,3,1,tomcatBS,"Hi folks, I was wandering, while watching the game progress if wood and stone professions are well balanced? Wood gathering is fun, and imposes a lot of interesting challanges.
You have to search for it and go there.
You spend a lot of kCal chopping it.
You have to ""drag"" it home.
And you have to replant it and wait relatively long.
What you get is ""just"" wood. For stone it appeares drastically different:
With one hit you break the block and can collect (second hit appeares to occure quite rarely)
You can Dig in a straight line, not worrying about elevation, and so have the luxury to use Carts.
Your Supply of stone practically does not run dry, since behind a harvested block is always the next one.
You do not have to travel the world for your Stone, you can just dig anywere.
You do not have to replant
You do not have to wait.
And on top of it you get all available ores as a bonus.
And you get coal, not even being dependant on Lumberjacks for firewood for lighting and furnace. Do not get me wrong, I am not jealous. I have both professions.
But I find it suspicious, that I can dig propostrous large tunnels into Rock, during the same time my friend ""struggles"" to chop down 1 Tree, including downtimes for carrying his stuff home.
Oh, and did I mention, that he on top has to manually chop the seeds, bevor chopping the tree? From Places he can almost not reach? ;-) Seriously, I think Stone should not break on 1st hit. Make it like the trees! Coulple of hits to break the Block and then some hits to collect the bite size pieces. And maybe it is worth to think about the carrying weight of stone :-) Just my 2 cents, have fun! :-)"

But i think this is balanced within the game. When we look at Tier 1 building materials:
Mortared Stone = 8 Stone + 3 pitch
Hewn Log = 2 log's Tier 2 building materials:
Brick = 20 stone + 5 Pitch
Lumber = 10 log's So i agree with you that log's are more difficult to gather.
But then this is why their are worth more than stone."

They can obviously gain your currency by selling stuff to you or through contracts. However you as the player trying get people to use your currency, in your store, you will never gain anything because your personal currency is always inf (up until the point that someone starts minting money).

We had a game where it was really hard to gain skills and me being the Carpenter. People ended up begging me to buy stuff so they could afford basic furniture, boards etc and eventually they chose MY credits as a currency traded in their shops as well. Of course this meant I had unlimited access to all their products, but that was okay. ALSO you can donate your credits to anyone by using the /pay command, so this way you might enforce the use of ""your"" currency. However, you're still right, that it basically makes more sense to wait for a proper currency. Still, it's nice to get the prices (economy) setup before the currency comes, I think."

Then people will sell things like stone or wood for your recipes that you don't  need to focus on. Also make use of reputation. I always give 1 or 2 to my early customers to get more people trading with me.

general,maps | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4596/maps,1096,8,7,ShaydenMac,"This probably has to do with your ports. You now use your gameport instead of webport to connect, so if you used to connect to port 3001, you would now use 3000 if you used default ports. If creating a standalone server on a machine with the client server already installed through the game, you have to use ports other than the default, perhaps 4000 and 4001, although you always use 2999 as the listening port and share with the client.  You may have to check out your support pages for your ISP to learn about your router or google your router make and model for a manual to read information about port forwarding.  Usually your ISP support site will have information on port forwarding for your modem/router. If the router is not from your ISP or they do not have that information for you, there are many guides online about how to do this, and it is a relatively easy process. Next important thing:  If your server's not showing up, you need to go into appdata/LocalLow/Strange Loop Games/ and delete the Eco folder then restart Eco and it will write new files.  To get it to populated you may need to open the filter (middle button between search and refresh) and click 'apply'."

The problem you face with going meatless is trying to get quality fat and protein sources, which is typically what you get with most meat and meat derived food. Camas Bread is a good source of fat for a more advanced level of food, but unfortunately a bit too high in terms of carbohydrates so will throw off your food balance regardless.  Corn Fritters (requires Culinary Arts) can get a bit better without throwing your carb balance out.  The best vegetarian food for fat is a Bear Claw... but again watch those carbs. Sadly, the best source of 100% vegetarian protein is Campfire Beans.... and pretty lousy source of food except to try and rebalance  your diet. Vegetarian sources of vitamins and carbs are plentiful. The best bet for a vegetarian meal is likely Bear claws, Crimson Salad, and a few Tortillas to raise your protein level.  It still will be off balance but does avoid getting meat.

The difference is mainly one of gauge (distance between rails) and the size of the rail itself. It would be completely reasonable to have mine rails and a narrow gauge railroad use the same set of tracks, switches, and buffers (blocks at the end of a rail line that stops vehicles from going further).  A small gauge is particularly useful for tight turns like would be needed in a mine and for a personal ""hobby railroad"" that some players might want to build on their lots."

(will update to 6.2 soon) Once again Crok in game takes in depth look into another profession.
This time I am gonna write about Farming.
You are very welcome to help build up this post by commenting below. In this thread you will find: ==========================================================================================================How to Farm? Gain a skill scroll of Agriculture by either researching it at Research Station or buy/trade/steal from other players To do so you most likely will require Gathering skill as You will recieve Scythe, or You can simply craft it at workbench or above.
Same goes for Shovel - You will need it for terraforming terrain around, to get one You can either level up Laborer or craft Shovel at workbench or above.
Most important tools of them all are Hoe and Soil Sampler which can be obtained through leveling Agriculture and/or crafting at workbench or above and at farmer's table. You will not be able to farm without seeds which are obtained during picking up plants. Have everything?
Pick up a Hoe and use it on dirt/grass to till ground for a farm
Select seed You want to farm and use it on tilled ground.
Now simply wait till seed mature into fully grown plant which will require a lot of time (at least several hours) ==========================================================================================================Where to Farm?
You can ineffectively farm almost everywhere.
Put bit dirt on the spot with shovel, till with hoe, seed and wait.
Nothing hard, right?
Of course, but your yield will be low that's why You need to know where to farm. Near Rivers:
Huckleberries
Fiddleheads (also called Fern)
Crimini Mushrooms and poisonous Amanita
Beans Hills and/or mountains:
Corn
Fireweed On the desert:
Pickle Pear Hills:
Camas Combined:
Beets
Tomatoes
Wheat Under water:
Kelp Not implemented:
Rice ==========================================================================================================Why Farming is important? Large amounts of plants sed in one place saves time (especially in late game).Perservation of species.
Prickly Pears requires desert farming which some worlds may contain limited amount of deserts. ==========================================================================================================Which plants are good for farming and which are not? Most of them are good for farming with few exceptions likeFern, because finding 100% spot is unbelievably hard and due to amount of fern and limited usage in cooking it is simply not recommended. Bunchgrass, because it is a grass and it grows everywhere and regrowth is quick :) Huckleberries, because in most of the worlds You will find thousands of bushes - unless You are bad at cooking or require enormus amounts of huckleberries Tomatoes, because time to mature is over 24 hours ==========================================================================================================Plant descriptions: Amanita Mushroom
Grows near rivers and under bushes. Hard to gather unless You have scythe or spam 'use' button near bushes.
Pros:
Temperature Resilience
Cons:
One of highest moisture requirements
Useless, just like grass, unless You want to die :) Beans
Pros:
High amounts of Beans in each pickup Beet
Pros:
Moderate moisture requirements
Cons:
Low amounts of beets for each pick up
Temperature vulnerability Camas
Pros:
Very low moisture requirement
Cons:
Requires shovel to pick up Corn
Cons:
Farm on top of the mountains Crimini Mushroom
Cons:
High farming expectations Fern:
Pros:
Temperature Resilience
Cons:
Just like Huckleberries but less useful
Moisture requirements
Low base pick up value Fireweed
Pros:
Does not requires moist ground
Cons:
Temperature vulnerability
Very low cooking value Huckleberries
Pros:
Temperature Resilience
Easy to harvest, near every river
One of most used plant in cooking
Cons:
Moisture requirement
High Maturity time requirement Prickly Pear
Cons:
Endangered Species
Requires Desert Tomato
Pros:
Easy to harvest
Almost everywhere
Cons:24 hours to mature (or more) Waterweed
Pros:
CO2 absorb?
Cons:
Must be under water Wheat
Cons:
Requires Scythe to harvest
Required for better cooking
Mousture vulnerability ==========================================================================================================Helpfull Skills AgricultureFarming Tools - lvl 1 is absolutely must have for every Farmer in the game Desert Farming - no use unless endangered species
Forest Farming - no use unless endangered speciesGrassland Farming - lvl 1 is absolutely must have for every Farmer in the game
Tundra Farming - no use unless endangered species
Water Farming - no use unless endangered species Desert Seed Yield - level up only if prickly pears are endangered species
Forest Seed Yield - pointless since You will not farm Fern but collect whole game this skill is only good if You're interested in creating Forest, level up only if Fern/Trees are endangered speciesGrassland Seed Yield - this skill is a shining pearl for every Farmer as it increases seed yield for most of the plants
(Beans, Beet, Camas, Corn, Tomato, Wheat)
Tundra Seed Yield - since this skill only applies to Fireweed it is pointless,  level up only if Fireweed are endangered species
Water Seed Yield - useless level up only if Kelp/Waterweed are endangered species If You intend to create massive farms Grassland Seed Yield lvl 2 might be a good idea, or if You want to farm everything near You SurvivalGathering - lvl 1 is absolutely must have for every Farmer/Chef in the gameForest Forager - early must have if You want to cook properlyGrassland Gatherer - must have , preferably lvl 2
Wetlands Wanderer - optional, if You intend to farm mushrooms
Desert Drifter - level up only if prickly pears are endangered species
Tundra Traveler - since this skill requires two other to level up - I do not see any sense leveling up that far, unless You are Chef and want to feed whole world Tools
Are vital for better Farming
Every single farmer should get tools upgrade as soon their farms spreads over 500 plants ========================================================================================================== To Dev: ideas / improvement"

I guess they aren't really needed since they are all over the game but I wanted something to start as I build up my seed base. I did have one question though, are those in game tooltips? That show the yield, moisture match and maturity? I was looking for a way to see information like this but don't know how to view this in game."
general,Farming Research 6.0.3 | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2993/farming-research-6-0-3,3948,7,3,Nes,"I think you can still see all this information with the Soil Sampler in-game (click on the ground below the plant, not the plant itself). When the temperature match and moisture match are closest to 100, the total yield and growth rate will be highest. I'm not sure why your tomatoes are taking so long. Agriculture is one of those things that they are probably overhauling in Beta. I don't think it's going to persist in its current form."

As of the latest release build, the soil sampler should still know most of the information you need, but keep in mind that farming will change moving forward. We're adding the ability to overlay world layers into the game via the minimap (you can see them in the normal viewport, but you toggle the view on the minimap window) which should help a bit with viewing information."
general,Farming Research 6.0.3 | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2993/farming-research-6-0-3,3948,7,5,Razorflare,"@craig.jong Given what was said in this post (3 months old now) What has changed since. Im finding it hard to believe that some of the grassland species such as wheat, camas, beets...etc. Require so much space around them. I feel like im missing something, because i have had to plant my wheat plots almost 3-4 spaces away from each other and this has led to a very large sparce farm, and even then most of my wheat dies out. Huckleberry seems to thrive with very high yields in grassland area, and they are placed next to each other with no spacing. However, the farming tool for testing the ground told me they are overcrowded. Is it possible that maybe the farming mechanic isnt fully working. Im at odds with how the mechanic is suppsed to be, giving that the game is slightly mirrored to RL, with regards to a developing society and how to maintain growth. If farming tractors are coming into the game, shouldnt i be able to build large plots of fields of dense plants similar to real life. Realistically wheat, corn, soy, strawberries, etc... are pretty much planted next to each other and not spread out like whats representative in ECO. Dont get me wrong, im loving this game, i jsut feel farming could be so much more. im eager to see farming grow into a major industry in the game, to allow for many different types, like hydroponic, aquaponic, Greehouse, etc... cheers"

general,Growth of plants | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3641/growth-of-plants,5853,16,4,emmeck,I'm pretty sure there is a config file that can be modded to speed up growth but I'm not sure which one it would be. Also the single player or local hosted version of the game may have a slightly faster growth rate to begin with as it's not running all the time the growth would likely have been modified with this in mind

MaturityAgeDays: 4 edit the number behind the last one and you will have a much faster growing plant.
notice that the Number behind is always counted in full days! I recommend 0.02 for any trees and 0.003 for plants. I hope it helped"

general,Growth of plants | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3641/growth-of-plants,5853,16,10,LordTylus,"In My opinion the growth rates of plants make sense when you play on a Server thats online 24/7. I mean most of the day you sleep or work anyway so its cool. Still the growth of trees is pretty slow. For my Single Player game right now I manage to get through everything using /eat. Since the ""server"" is offline when I am not playing. I have to play 19 hours non stop for my tomatoes to grow. In the mean time I have basically eaten everything that occurs in the wild. Instead of editing every plant manually to make it somewhat playable It would be cool to have (at least for single player) a function for a Plant-Growth Multiplier.. The Multiplier for Skill-Points on SP seems to be 24. So why not using the same for plants... I mean apart from the obvious reason that things Like trees would overgrow the whole planet in no time. I think waiting 6 hours for a tree is somewhat reasonable on Singleplayer. For tomatoes, corn and what not it should not be longer than 1 to 2 hours. Even tho the bug that was recently fixed that plants grow instantly on server start was helping very well on SP: Every hour when food supply was low I just relogged and was able to harvest everything again. That was pretty cool."

I have tested the website in the latest stable versions of Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Edge. Internet Explorer is not supported. The tools are not designed for mobile devices, but the rest of the site should work fine on your phone or tablet. The tools probably also work, but they're in no way designed for mobile devices.

What you can do is can use the Eco API to do what you want. They do seem to work on a fresh local server just fine but return a value of 0 on my hosted server but it probably just has to be wiped. One thing you could try is just getting the playerstats, for example: http://SERVER_IP:PORT/api/v1/analysis/playerstats/USERNAME?startDay=7&endDay=14 You will get a JSON encoded response back containing a list of the specified player's stats and one of those is Learn Skill which will say something like ""Summary"": ""learned 78 skill points"". That might not be exactly what you're looking for. If you want individual skills you can query them with the dataset/get API operation by sending a JSON encoded dataset like so:
[""Humans"",""USERNAME"",""Learn Skill"", ""Surivalist""]
OR
[""Humans"",""USERNAME"",""Learn Skill"", ""Surivalist"",""Basic Crafting""] To view the API documentation you can go to http://SERVER_IP:PORT/swagger"

Try encasing it in mortared stone at least 10 blocks below the nearest dirt/water blocks. I have heard various advice on this matter and the general rule is deeper is better. I have also heard that you can now encase  tailings above ground now too. Has not been tried on the server i am on currently but If you are impatient then it is probable worth a try just be prepared for the problems that may follow. Also make sure it is within a stockpile.

As far as I can tell the ground pollution is from the smoke and will clear up pretty quickly as long as there is no air pollution in the area for a bit. I'm pretty sure it has been this way since around alpha 5.4.4 if not even before that. I'm relatively sure all air pollution causes slight ground pollution while present but will go away once the air is no longer polluted

I have Steam and understand Mac's can't run servers there (yet?) I don't seem to be able to play in a single player world of my own either. if I pay for one of those dedicated server cloud places, can I run a server that way? my first two servers were abandoned by the admins, leaving me all alone until the servers went offline so I lost everything I'd built (boo hoo) and I have no way of knowing if or when the next server I choose might also go belly up. I'd also like to start fresh, on a new world, rather than join another on the list, as most of those are weeks/months old and leave me at the mercy of more admins I don't know and who could abandon the server again. I don't mean to poop on your parade but it seems like 90% of the servers listed have no actual ""active users"" or require passwords and I rarely ever see anyone at all ""online"" actually playing the game in a world I can access, let alone play in, let alone start fresh in on a relatively equal level with the other players, know what I mean? thanks for any suggestions..... apologies for my frustrations..... just trying to to play this game on a world I can call my own, ya know?

I checked some cliff plots with extreme differences between the z levels of various blocks, and the temperature doesn't change. Likewise, irrigation - if it's working as intended - ignores z levels at the moment. You should even be able to create a floating farm this way. On mountainous maps you can use this to your advantage by excavating farm areas into cliff sides.
You can also take a triple optimal plot and build a farm tower. Even bushes don't seem to suffer much from extreme overcrowding, and with high enough skill levels you'll get a minimum yield of 6 per plant anyway, even if base yield is only 1."

maybe nobody knows, maybe some body figured it out or maybe we need eco developers to point us in the right direction. What we know, crop seeds, can be planted on Tilled soil, and need specific conditions to grow faster and have a higer yield,
1: Temprature match.
2: Total Soil moisture.
these 2 are easy and we can all figure it out, and so far the result is, a faster growth rate and a bit better yield i would say. 3: Nitrogen,Phosphorus,potassium. these are the 3 substances in the soil, i believe the ration affect the yield a crop gives.
but there are so many numbers to go on, with out a litle basic info, i dont think many people will be able to figure it out the rules to apply the logic in what value's effect what, so the know what soil is good or bad, what type of fertilizer's to add to grow what kinda crops. I'l post a immage here with 2 pieces of land close to eachother of Beets growing with temprature/soil moisture almost the same but not the nutrition in the soil. giving difrent result in overall growth time and overall yield rate, how to read the Nitrogen/Phosphorus/Potassium, C - P - D - B,  I hope some body can explain the puzzle how to affect the growth/yield rate in a logical way."

So say you wanted to grow corn. Find a spot on your server with lots of it growing naturally test some of the soil around that zone. What the tester reads in that area will be the soil specs you will need to grow the corn efficiently.

This info helped a lot... but i still have so many questions... Alderone made a good point about sampling wild plants. I went out and did just that and quickly found that a few of my nutes were highish near my camp. Ferts are obviously additive, but is there any way to reduce nutrients in the soil?  Is there a way to flood the farmland to reduce nutes? We haven't set up any aqueducts yet so haven't had a chance to test it, just curious if thats a thing or am i just stuck with over nuted soil?"

I found perfect temp and Moisture for my beets only have them at a 42% growth rate.  I tried adding fertilizer but it doesn't seem to have made a difference. It would be nice if maybe there was a color coding letting you know like blue is low, Green is good and red is high. I am finding it so frustrating waiting 12 hours for beets to grow yet my corn is ready in about 3 hours.  The beets are in perfect temp and moisture, while the corn if off a bit yet my corn is at 89% growth rate and the beets are at 43%. a color code would be nice Changing the color of the number rather than the text I am putting after Nitrogen:                          C(139.5) 'Green' P(151.3) 'Red'
Phosphorus:                    C(114.5) 'Blue' P(133.5) 'Green'
Potassium:                      C(176.5) 'Red' P(215.8) 'Red' Now I know that 176.5 may not be high but this was just an example of how it could make the process of using the correct fertilizers a bit easier, as it is even with something like that getting the soil above 90% will still probably be a challenge. or simple put  something like this Nitrogen:                          C=Good P=High
Phosphorus:                    C=Low P=Good
Potassium:                      C=High P=Very high I play on a server with 21 other people, lets face it with that many active people farming is a must, I just wish it was a little easier to understand the nutrients."

You use them to move water from fresh sources to your farm and it increases the soil moisture @toxxikz said: I like the idea, but i think you might be a little confused about the numbers. For all intents and purposes, we shouldn't even know anything other than C (current value of the soil) from the soil sampler. P is just the next projected change to the soil, which a sampler wouldn't really be able to tell you, D is just the delta of that change, and B is the base value of the land that the block will naturally try to return to, which in reality you would just sample the ground where you haven't ferted to get a good estimate. But yes, definitely something to help indicate the status of the plants. Crops in really life have very obvious warning signs that they are getting too many or not enough nutrients. They'll start yellowing, they'll have poor structure development causing droops, etc. Infographics YAY!"

general,"Aggriculture, how it works ? | ECO Forum",https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2020/aggriculture-how-it-works,31488,37,11,toxxikz,"@Lhamabomb , I understand the idea behind the numbers and you are correct in the real world there would be physical signs with the plants and not numbers, but the difficult part is how do you show that in the game.  I guess you could litterally program the plants to show up in different shades depending on soil, but that's a lot of if else and conditional formating with so many possible variables. Here is an example of two of my beans 2 blocks apart   What I can tell from this is the bean in the first pic is doing better than the bean in the second pic.  From the looks of it the bean in the second picture has more Nitrogen and that is probably a contributing factor as to why it is not doing as good.  But how do I determine what the nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium should be for this plant.  I understand the numbers and the current compared to the future state at the next tick there is no change.  Now i did add fertilizer to the second one which is why it has a higher nitrogen compared to the base value.  But come to find out that means the nitrogen is too high and i shouldn't have added the fertilizer that I did.  I will have to experiment more with other fertilizers to do the same for the other two nutrients, but if I add fertilizer and find out that they are now too high as well, how do i lower the nutrients?  In the real world you cut the soil with un-enriched soil, I am not sure how to do that in this game.  I have looked at all of the fertilizers and they all increase all three nutrients, none that say increase nitrogen and phosphorus while lowering potassium, or vice versa.  This makes it hard to find the right fertilizer as well because while raising one you are also forced to raise the others slightly making it more difficult to fine tune the soil. Don't get me wrong i like the experimenting to find what works, it has kept me busy while waiting on skill points to generate, which it almost seems like the food i am making is barely keeping me at decent skill/day, I am not sure how i am supposed to provide the food for everyone else on my server as it seems by time my crops have grown and I make food I am using most of it to keep my calories up enough to continue progressing and don't really have enough to provide to others.  The smithing and Masonry specialist on my server only play a few minutes a day because they are constantly burning through calories at the high rate due to cost of materials while I am not able to provide enough food to keep them going for very long before I am having to wait on crops again to make more food.  I suppose they could drop to about 30-40 skill/day and just eat a lot of raw vegetables to have the calories to keep going but then that slows the progress of the server as i am now waiting 2 days to get the 32 mortared stone to expand for baking because everyone else is putting in the same orders for what they need and the masonry specialist is just burning through too many calories too quickly to supply us all, while I am not able to keep up with the demand for food to keep their skills per day at a decent rate. The other specializations are dependent on me for food, but feeding them all is a bit taxing, and most of them don't want to drop back to 30 skill/day, and even if they did the amount of raw food they would need to eat would deplete the entire planet of crops way too quickly. i could talk more about balancing out the supply demand balance but I already wrote a book.  But for specializing in farming and food I am falling short on my server and people are now only playing a few minutes a day when they can get the food to keep their skills/day up without burning through so many calories that they completely deplete the food I am able to make.  it is becoming where we don't have specialist anymore because the specialist aren't on long enough and I am having to take on masonry and smithing to get my oven and stove and kitchen because they aren't on enough to be dependable and I am waiting days for them before I can actually progress. The key takeaway is the server runs on calories and supply for those calories, but when farming takes hours to supply someone with the calories they burn through in 15 mins it just seems unbalanced as far as the need for calories and the need for materials.  Now everyone doesn't need 200 skill/day, but they need enough to be able to increase efficiency enough to not burn through calories so fast if that makes sense."

I have tried to encourage the other players to invest points in farming but they say they are having enough trouble with getting efficient in their own specialization that they can't afford to and that's what they have me for is the farming. So what you're saying is that the lack of food is intentional to slow down the progression of the servers?  good luck beating the meteor, isn't that kind of the point of the game progress and beat the meteor but see what the effects are on your Eco system, start over try again and try to be more eco conscious and make progress each time to having a more healthy planet?"

I have farms going pretty good but when you have 5 people all coming at you every 10 minutes for food that takes 10 mins to make you start falling short again.  I am hoping they get their efficiencies up quickly so they are not using as much food but one can only hope. @Lhamabomb I am very pleased with farming and cooking once I got the efficiencies up, glad I had a lot of seeds because all of the beans on the planet are gone except what I am farming but I have increased my farm and it is doing much better.  I do understand now how the curve from beginner to expert farmer and cooker was designed and while it may seem frustrating at first it feels very satisfying once you get there.  Like i mentioned above, now if I can only convince the others on my server to start putting more skills into efficiencies that would make all the difference, but they are trying to progress through the profession as quick as they can and not realizing how they are depleting the resources by not using efficiencies earlier on."

I feel like something has changed since 1.06 or so.  I used to grow them on my farm just fine.  They grew just like everything else.  Now, something is different. No matter where I grow them, (I've tried three different spots in the middle of the tomato yield potential heat map) they are are not viable.  Literally as soon as I plant them, the heat map changes to nothing.  They take at least 4 full days to grow.  By that time, about 98% of them have died.  This is the same situation with everyone on my server.  We've tried soil samplers and this isnt helping.  They are not over crowded either.  Everything else grows amazing except for tomatoes. Am I missing something?  Is there something up with Tomatoes?  IS the Tomato yield heat map wrong now?  My understanding is that fertilizer is not working at the moment.  Any insight would be very helpful.  Thank you!"

What looks like a fully grown tomato plant may be 90% grown. Which has lower than the usual 100% chance of dropping fruit. Sometimes a plant is grown but the game visuals lag behind. Dig a block nearby to force an update."

I, like many of you, have taken an interest in farming on the server me friends and I play on. I also however find the farming to be slightly convoluted and confusing. So I thought maybe through our combined efforts and discoveries we could try and figure all the numbers and nitty-gritty out! I have started a spreadsheet with all the info for the plants I have found so far, along with the math on how I got to those values. Everything labeled under ""baseline"" are the values for the tilled block without anything planted in it, and every subsequently labeled column are the values for that labeled plant in the same block. Obviously everything isn't quite finished yet, and is still VERY much a work in progress, but I wanted to share what I had so far! I also have done zero experimentation with the fertilizers in game, hence why those values are excluded in my final values.

Someone made research on the topic and stated: ""The temp and soil moisture is for a 5x5 area, the same size as a claim plot. Temperature and moisture are averaged from surrounding terrain and applied to the entire 5x5 plot.Temperature is regulated by altitude."" Also: ""Moisture is determined by rainfall and terrain drainage. Nutrient depletion is escalated when plots are dense and ""overcrowded"". Nutrient depletion is minimized when crops have ""enough room"". You can alter the terrain to change both temperature and soil moisture. It takes 10-30 minutes for any terrain changes to take affect.

Its too punishing and not fun.  Why even try?
It creates an unhealthy environment on the server.  IE, everyone needs wood but no real mechanic exists to make it renewable.
Fully specced, you get 6 seeds for about 10-20% of leaves chopped - Way too few.  Every other crop is drowning in seeds.
The entire server is full of trees with most of their leaves chopped away.
Leaves take a very long time to grow back - If ever.  It takes so long, I havent noticed any yet.
Heat maps are not that helpful.  Even at the center of a yield map, crops have a 10-30% chance way too frequently.
Saplings die way too quickly and easily.
There is no dead sapling graphic.  This makes it more tedious and time consuming to constantly run around the server using the sampler to figure out what is going on.
Saplings die almost all the time and are too sensitive to over crowding.
The few saplings that make it, take 120 hours under optimal conditions (which never exist) to mature.
I spend too many hours attempting this only to have it fail most of the time. How it should be:
Seeds drop like crazy with the gathering spec.  (Just like they do with every other crop)
If planted within the proper heat yeild map, saplings should only fail 15-20 percent of the time.
You need a dead tree sapling graphic
Tree leaves grow back more quickly  or come up with another seed generation mechanic
Oak and fur saplings please.
More accurate heat maps.
Less over crowding problems.  Real forests have trees crammed all over the place.
Faster growth times. Trees should fully grow in three or fewer days.
We need a mechanic to allow decorative planting of trees on our bases.  IE, plant wherever and whichever type we want. I get it.  Trees are precious and hard to grow back.  I get the message trying to be sent.  However, its too much.  It makes everyone just say screw it.  It's disheartening.  After 9 days, people are cruising around on powered carts and I'm still mucking around trying to get one in ten damn saplings to take.  Wood is just not fun or even interesting.  Its way too punishing.  Why even try?  Not to mention we have a huge demand for it on the server, and no real mechanic to make it renewable. Thank you for listening."

A planter with 0 level forestry I am able to almost repopulate what I cut down. Heres what I noticed so far: To Selway: The game is about managing hard to- or non-renewable resources. Seems to me like an incentive to good, meaningful decisions. Replanting trees is costly, hard and not much worth it. Much like what we observe in real life. Cherish what we got.
Low drop chances are a way to keep the wood constantly relevant. The game already gave us a way to save the forests by laws making. And an incentive to save it by needing wood and keeping the sea levels low.
Heat maps are, in my opinion accurate but lack details. Adds realism and requires player skill to read them properly. Its hard to find the, as you say, center of a heat map.
Even if you find the center, it still could be lower than optimal. You could always find another extremum or terraform. Moisture can be modified with nearby water bodies. Burying them or bringing them with aqueducts, pipes. Temperature of a 5/5 sector depends on height. Seems to be the average of the sector. Underground mines may interfere. Example: the edge of a heat map for a plant borders with my house. The roof of my house is sunlike glowing.
Actual soil tolerance is the same for the whole sector. Many factors may affect a given sector. A heat map is so precise, it shows you the factors meter by meter but actual tolerance is the average for the sector.
Not having a que for dead saplings is a pain, I agree.
I would for someone to explain to me how overcrowding is calculated.
I've noticed some plants are more sensitive to different factors. A certain plant is very sensitive to slightly lower temperature but doesnt mind high temp. Makes sense for the trees to need space.
In a (modded) server on 7.0.5, plants and trees are shown with a constant time to mature, regardless of soil tolerance. Sampler says tolerance affects their survival rate. Someone said about an old version, a plant with zero tolerance has about 50% chance to survive. I like the game so far but everyone has its own preferences and tastes.
Whatever we talk about, it may all be subject to change. The game is still in active development and such game balances should be the last to change. Features are balanced after all features are introduced. They might let us fiddle with the stats and chances when creating a world. So there would be a preferred world for anyone. I love the game so far and I hope it stays on the right track."

Very new to the game, i'm playing with friends and i'm looking forward repopulating trees. Recently i stacked 50 cedar tree seeds and went to plant them on decent conditions (100% temp match, 50%+ moisture match).
I tried to space them with only 1 tile since i didnt find much land fitting the requirements. I assumed it would be ok based on another forum thread but that might be outdated : most of saplings died (roughly 75%) within first 15mn after planting them.

iron tailings used in cement are 12% stronger and thus highly re-processed. here the relevant patchnotes. -Gold Ingot
stays at 4000 Weight which equals to 12.4 kg or 74.4 Kg for 6 Ingots. -Iron Ingot
has been changed to 1600, since Gold is 2.45 times denser than Iron. -Copper Ingot
has been changed to 1700, since Copper is a little denser than Iron. -Gold Tailings
have been reduced to 1 Since the gold tailing solid/Liquid Ratio is 40:60 and 1MT of mined Ore generates 2.49 MT of Tailing. -Iron Tailings
have been reduced to 1 to match the cleaner processing and reflect the re-processing of iron tailing (e.g.cement) -Copper Tailings
have been increased to 3 to match the 90-98% generated tailing from processing copper ore."

Make your currency worth spending for: make loads of shops with valuable goods for everyone to use; if one or two start to use it more will follow. Beside mods that will probably roll out sooner or later; other than that try to spread your currency as far as possible with as many players as you can. Promote the mint, treasury,... so players actually know what's going on. I'm sure if there is a general town or a decent store set up you can easily spread your currency amongst the server population. A few alpha's back i once was on one server where we had one currency; it was the first and we were... 3-5 players; nobody else was using any other kind of currency so it doesn't make any sense to use anything else really so we had one global currency: it made the most sense. If your currency is the first; promote it on discord / in-game and i'm sure players will follow if you create a demand. You can also make contracts which offer rewards (check the contract board) - in this case your currency - to start spreading it even more easily. Simple tasks can be performed: cut trees on your territory; hand in trees at stockpile X, get reward currency; be creative! :D"

My question about this is, is the accepting of the contract increasing the (if contract x2 is greater) now? Or does this happen after the entire law has finished running through its logic chain. The way I see it, one of two things will happen. 1.When the player is attempting to accept their 3rd contract, the game will read that the player has accepted 2 contracts, denying them the reward, finishing the logic chain and then complete the contract acceptance putting their accepted contracts up to 3, or:"

I then start the game, click join. I see the world i created at the top in yellow it says Lan. If I click connect it says connection failed.

Double check to make sure your account has been properly credited as buying the double pack. I think the old standard copy (single copy) was brown icon on the account screen. If you account icon is a silver color then you should be fine. Hopefully it shows up but otherwise most certainty a problem. When i invited my friends it only took a minute or two for the website to update and the keys to show up so open a support ticket is probably a good idea. ~Cheers sorry this happened to you."

general,Difficulty | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3314/difficulty,2349,2,1,mPicart,"Can the server be set to scale the difficulty to the numbers of players registered in a world?
Playing on a public server with 100 players would affect the planet differently than a private server set to, let's say, 10 players Max; but it'd be nice to be as difficult.
So, for example, it might adjust the total number of resources, maybe representing a much smaller planet?"
general,Difficulty | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3314/difficulty,2349,2,2,Rushyo,"Yes. The world generation and game rules are in the hands of the admin. The main 'difficulty' factor is collaboration modifiers, in a 1-4 person game you will have 'very low' collaboration generally and in a high person server you'd have 'very high' collaboration. This basically limits skill rates and alters the costs of specialising in multiple fields. This is generally a better way to represent larger and smaller communities than simply giving everyone 'more stuff'."

I have been playing ECO on and off since 5.4 or so. Tailoring used to be completely broken, but has since had atleast one overhaul to make it function, somewhat, in game. But still the clothes you craft do not show up on your avatar. If you don full camogear the clothes are so well camouflaged that they are infact invisible and it looks like you are running around in your underwear. My nickname on sevral servers has been ""Nice Skivvies"". But not beeing able to actually see the items you craft is not even the main issue. Where has the love for tailoring gone? It has to be one of the most neglected and overlooked skills in the entire game with the possible exception of Logging Efficiency which does absolutely nothing except trick people into spending skillpoints unnesseccarily. There is so much more that could be done with tailoring. Where are the Flags, Banners and Pennants to Fly over our homes and lands?
Where are the Draperies, Curtains, and Tapestries to decorate our walls?
Where are the table cloths to cover our tables?
Where are the Chefs hat and Apron?
Where are the Metalworkers leather apron and protective clothing?
Where are the dyes and patterns to color and define the artistry of the craft?
Where are the myriad of clothing choices to aid each specialization?
Where is the option to customize size, color and pattern of our carpets. Frankly speaking, where has the love gone? //Adam"

I wanted to post this, as it seems a lot of players, new and old, are having a hard time with 6.4+ So, bare in mind I am by no means an expert, and only learn this info from either being a dum-dum or from word of mouth from other players/Developers. First, and foremost, as soon as you load up on a new server you must find out what kind of world you have landed in. If this is a very new world, you will not have many choices for Professions. New worlds will have a bit more choices. Chat with other players and find what needed. You could also just pick whatever you wish as well. Once you have chosen your first Profession DO NOT PICK ANOTHER ONE RIGHT OFF THE BAT.  Yes, the second one IS cheap, but you will need to focus on your own Profession! Focus on being the best of whatever you have chosen! Every player will have Survival. Survival will help you research faster and cheaper. They also can make Storage Chest and Stockpile. Increase your carry weight and allowing you to have more calories, so you can eat more food to have better skill points! If you spend points in the Specialization: Basic Craft, Hewing, or Mortaring it WILL give you a free workbench as well. Each Specialization will majorly increase. First one is Free. The second one is 5. The 3rd one will cost 38 points. 4th one, 130 and so on. Once you pick your first Specialization, all the skills in that one will be cheap, costing from 1 to 3 points each time. If there are no chefs on the server yet, you will have to eat a lot of raw food. Dive underwater to get raw fish from clams and urchins. Pick up Corn, Huckleberries, Beets, Fiddleheads, Tomatoes, and Beans with your hands. If you have chosen Farming(or made a shovel) you can get Camas, if you Specialize Gathering as a Farmer you get a free Stone Sycthe(or if you make one) you can harvest Wheat and Fireshoots. If there IS a chef, make quick friends with them! Trade what you can make for food to help with skill points. When building your room, not only will you need to make it big enough for your crafting tables, but for house items as well! Each of them will need 25m³! One room with just a chair and a table will get you about .4 house value(does not sound like much, but at the beginning they DO help!) Have your logger friend hook you up with these, if you are not one! Players who are Loggers(Carpenters) that got a free ax, or players that traded/made an ax can chop trees down to make logs. placing 4 logs down can make a log block. Log blocker is Tier 0 materials for house building. Some crafting tables need Tier 1 or higher to 'work' in. Check the Status Tab on the table to see what it needs. Placing logs on the ground and then chopping them again with an ax will turn them into Hewn Logs. One log can make one Hew log. Hew Log are Tier 1. You can make a nice wooden house with Hew. Using a hammer you can turn the logs(Hold Shift and use the mouse wheel to cycle thru the crafting menu) into floors, walls, windows, stairs, and roofs. Players who are Masons that got a free pickax, or traded/made a pickax can break stones into rubble. Four rubbles make a rubble block that can be used to build a Tier 0 Stone house. Later on, Masons can make Mortared Stone. Players can also make a dirt house with a shovel. This is still tier 0. Loggers, later on, will be able to make stores. This will help players trade items faster, even when others are offline! New worlds are harder. And could take a full Real day to get to the Bronze age (Having a player learn Smelting) A lot of older players are used to getting tons of skill scrolls before day 1. Players now in 6.4 have to communicate a lot now either with in-game chat or Discord to plan ahead. NOT ONE PLAYER can DO IT ALL. Once you get your skills points a day up to 49-50(easy to do with a good chef who makes campfire food) go ahead and pick a new Specialize from your Profession or a new Profession.  Just remember, you can not unlearn Profession/Specialize that gives you free tools/items. Those you can unlearn you will get 50% of the skill points back. Any and all feedback welcome :)"

I agree they went too far with this release as far as the exponential skill point costs, but the fortunate thing is that these problems can be solved with the adjustments of a few variables.

Especially the law system has changed dramatically. I don´t know if it is just bugged or intentionally. Maybe it is my english but I cannot make the laws I could make in 6.3.1. For example I had limited the !harvesting"" of Bisons to 1 per day on our server and 10 animals in total. I have no Ides to do that now. Same with Tailings. We forbid them totally after we had the blast furnace. Is that still possibble? I was hoping for law improvements, but it is the opposite. I would like motivate players by paying taxes to them for every planted tree for example. If I oversee something would be nice if someone could help me out, because I am sure I am not the only one.

Say a player removes them from the world are they gone forever and it is there a way to replant ?And if so do I need the farmer skill to replant? For example I pick some wheat in a wild and I don’t want it to run out for all the players so is there way for me to plant the seeds where I pick them?"
general,Question on planting | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3223/question-on-planting,902,2,2,King Korihor,"While I've seen some plants grow back naturally (aka they appeared after I harvested them), I really don't have a solid answer for you to respond in terms of how quickly they recover or how the recovery happens.  If somebody more familiar with the game could explain the regrowth mechanic, I'd love to hear from them too. The only thing the agriculture skill seems to do is increase seed yields and unlocks the ability to create fertilizer.  For most plants, if you want to increase the yield (aka the number you acquire from harvesting each plant), you need to increase the gathering skill instead. It does seem to be possible though to over harvest plants in the wild and cause a plant to be gone forever... potentially eliminated from the world entirely and destroyed in such a manner that some skills are completely unobtainable and that the world is dead to players. I've had an earlier rant about the agriculture skill on another thread and frankly it is very murky how it works.  Most players treat farming like they were using Minecraft where they randomly create farm plots irrespective of the local environment and plant whatever they think they need in whatever quantity they want.  I know that doesn't work either. Regardless, a good guide to farming is most definitely in order and documentation is non-existent regarding the incredibly complex interaction that takes place to really master the skill and understand the mechanics in this game."

general,Question on Wheat and in game currency? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3215/question-on-wheat-and-in-game-currency,982,3,3,King Korihor,"The problem with coins is that other players need to accept them in their stores.  IMHO it is a good move on the whole, but it does have some issues.  If you mint coins but nobody takes them, it still does you no good.  If you can get a large group of players on a server to accept coins, you are in really good shape though. People properly running stores will be both buying and selling products.  For instance, I have a carpentry shop that makes furniture and lumber but buys logs.  If you are willing to put in some effort harvesting trees and bring logs to the store, you will get the in-game currency to buy the other stuff at my shop.  That is the kind of thing most people should be doing... and make it pretty reasonable.  I have high efficiency in carpentry, so new players to a server would be better off selling logs to me and getting the stuff rather than training carpentry and instead concentrate on something else. As for wheat, it seems like heavy harvesting of wheat removes it from the wild.  The server I'm using most of the time now has a ""community wheat farm"" to help out with this sort of situation along with a chest of wheat seeds that is open.  Still, if it wasn't for that farm, most new players would be out of luck trying to get the agriculture skill book.  It makes cooperation so much more important on a server which has been running for more than a couple weeks. If people on the server you are using are hoarding something like wheat and not letting you at least get a few wheat seeds to sow on a plot of your own, it is time to move on to another server."

It counts as a part of your ""Home"" in addition to Living Room, Bathroom, Bedroom, and General Room.  You also need to ""balance"" each room, including second rooms (if applicable) so you have one of each and that the point values are the same for each room.  The second tier rooms need to be equal to each other. The Kitchen is problematic so far as if you upgrade your kitchen with new stuff like a mill, stove, etc. it can add points to that room and make you unbalanced with the rest of the house.  Either add furnishings to the other top tier rooms or take out furnishings like tables & chairs in your kitchen (likely a bit of both in practice).  The Butcher Table is excellent to start a kitchen as a new player, especially if you can get the butcher table from another player or at least the Butchery skill scroll... although even that isn't too hard to get. I was able to get to 50 skill points for my house in less than two days of being new on a server and starting from scratch.  A whole lot of work goes into that though, but obviously the skill points are worth it.  It can give you a much better boost to your skill points per day than almost any activity in the game right now, even though nutrition in the long run does do better."

It is a complex mechanic where it doesn't 100% make obvious sense where adding furniture to a room might even make the points per day go down (because it is an unbalanced house). Think of it like the nutrition, but applied to the various rooms of your house.  If you eat something, even with a lot of points, a whole lot with high carbs.... your skill points go down eating just that.  The same thing applies if you build just bathrooms or bedrooms.  You need to have a balanced house. You can also arrange your rooms in a tasteful manner, but stacking furniture works too if you just don't care.  Aesthetics are your responsibility, not the game's."

No, you don't need to build a separate house, but you do need to build separate rooms. It is the kitchen bonus that I've seen smack people the worst though, because they will often put kitchen elements (bakery oven, mill, butcher table) in the same room as other workshop tables like a carpenter's table and sawmill.  That causes the kitchen to be created but zeros out the value of the kitchen. If you want to put the other rooms in another building, go ahead.  For myself, I like to put them ""upstairs"", which I suppose is the same thing.  You need a whole lot of floor space anyway, and going up is the better way IMHO to get all of the rooms needed to get the full 50 point per day bonus. Watch that kitchen bonus in particular if you go for advanced cooking skills. I'll agree it is nice to get 100+ skill points per day, as that goes a very long way to go through the tech tree."

This also gives me the chance to correct the order of research advances. I had Culinary Arts after Advanced Baking but was told that for Advanced Baking you need Yeast i.e. Culinary Arts. So the following table shows food combinations in different ratios up to 3000 calories. I got this by writing a little brute force algorithm that still is not perfect, so there may be better combinations for bigger stomachs or if you keep track of your previous meals. The combination algorithm has a bug so also for 3000 cals there could be better ones but it gives a good start.
I assumed that you evolve your skills incrementally so before you learn Baking 1 you already have Campfire Creations 4 and so on. This all is for version 0.5.5.4. EDIT: Updated according to my post below. Campfire Cooking 1: 2 Campfire Beans, 5 Charred Camas Bulb: 1,3/52,1 out of 120 combinations

Thanks a lot for your request. That made me rewrite the algorithm to save time creating the list and, yeah, I got some better results making me rethink my personal ingame diet.

Thanks, Voyager!  I've been able to streamline my cooking operations to support the 'most sustainable', high output combinations, thanks to this plethora of data (sustainable means minimum input steps, minimal meat, fewest ingredients, etc, for the best skill point return).  Wild stew + a baked meat + camas bulb bake is really tough to beat, for a day of heavy calorie usage (146sp), while corn fritters + elk wellington + huckleberry muffin requires little, but yields 174sp, for those times when you're not burning calories at a high rate. You can work harder, kill all the animals, and get a touch more, but on the supplier-for-sale-side, that's our champion. Data rules <3 Thanks again! SMG"

Right now we only have a mac client. There is no mac servers. Since Eco is multiplayer only you can join any other server. So you can basically join any server that is on the same version that you are. The only thing right now you can not do is to host your own server on your mac. That said we are planing to release the server as a .net core application that will later be compatible with not only just windows but mac and linux too. I hope you did understand this =)

The servers are to death to play with this new system the created. You need to grind food and resources to repair your tools to often.
How i see it where its wrong:
1: we start the game with novice tools,
2: you find an area where you want to work build on
3: you gather food so you can start working(can be time consuming)
4: you work on your area where you will live
5: tools break gather more materials
6: run out of food get food
7: you work very little and your tools break again and from here on it repeats 4 to 6. We all know getting good food was already time consuming and hard to do. We needed dedicated farmers and cooks for that.
Now the made that tree's re spawn slower and the leave debris which costs us more energy and tool durability to remove... now getting wood becomes a problem together with food and tools.... its just to much for the game in its current state. I cant support the decision the made. The game was fun at least it wasnt such a hassel without the tool durability... Now it just became a manage your hunger and tools game."

It is quite incredible how much you can learn passively. You might not notice it but maybe in the future you will make slightly different decision and support an Eco friendly solution even though it might cost a bit more like an electric car  instead of a large diesel powered car. Who knows, maybe in the future you think about sorting trash or at least putting trash into a garbage bin instead out into nature...

I ride a bike, I turn off my appliances and lights when I'm not using them, I even pick up litter whenever I see it (just last month I pulled a couple of tires out of a stream near my house). Despite all this I don't feel like it's enough.
When I get a car I'm hoping to be able to afford an electric. Right now I only have access to my bicycle or my parents' minivan, which I feel bad about every time I drive it. My biggest hope is that we can switch our entire planet's energy grid to using wholly 100% renewable energy. I hear there's a technology that can harness the energy of ocean waves.

A goal of the game is to educate people on the impact they have, giving them a context with which to ground a real-world understanding of these issues, and an appreciation for the complexity and depth of it, as well as familiarity with the tools for doing something about (statistical analysis, ecosystem analysis, government action, regulation).  Reaching students when they're young, you can actually make a difference in the type of person that develops and what's important to them. Beyond that, more than anything I want the game to communicate complexity.  It's called Eco because its the root of Economy and Ecology, you can't neglect either, and the message is never as simple as 'don't pollute kids!'.  There's massive institutions all with overlapping needs and incentives. It's a thicket of a problem, which is why it isn't solved, and giving a contained version of that thicket to players is what I want do.  That will be valuable in many ways."

general,Plans for Singleplayer? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1329/plans-for-singleplayer,6999,12,3,NoBlackThunder,Howdy! yes we have seen that this is a highly requested feature. So we look at a later stage if we cant implement the server side into the client and create a singleplayer mode similar to other games. Right now though you still have to spin up a server if you like to play for your self in sort of a singleplayer mode
general,Plans for Singleplayer? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1329/plans-for-singleplayer,6999,12,4,Freds00n,"Hey Fizmer! I'm not sure why everyone desires SP for eco. I've also noticed that some people just love to do everything on their own BUT the game starts to shine when you actually start playing with friends or even strangers. You'd ask, ""but why freds00n?"", well it's as simple as that. Imagine, an entire world for you alone where, once you've put your building down, others start joining and gathering around - forming a city, everyone with their own job. We've got a cook to make delicious dishes (me!), an engineer who crafts wicked carts, a carpenter for all your fine wood and don't forget the blacksmith! The problem is; a huge meteor is threatening to destroy the world and take everyone and everything with it. Now this is just the basic thing what eco is about. I'm not even talking about pollution, extinction of plants/animals or even the human race/the planet, let alone the survival of yourself and others - mainly by food. The main goal of eco is to destroy this huge meteor together and overcome the threats of mother nature - keep a clean ecosystem running. You are able to play on a server just with you and friends but i highly recommend you to look for an active server with a nice community. I'm currently playing on one and everyone has got their own job to do - this way we work together as a team to eliminate all the threats. Everyone is also watching out for all the kind of threats so nothing bad will happen to the planet. Once you take away the meteor - the game still has a lot to offer with regard to the ecosystem (which basically happens 90% of the time) because the meteor hits earth in 30 IRL days - which is plenty of time to get you going, especially with an active and friendly community which divides tasks and takes jobs/responsibilities on them. :) So, whether you are here for the building fun, finding new friends (or joining the communities with your friends) or destroying badass meteors!... everyone's got a place to stay. Unfortunately the communities aren't that big yet and you are able to take away the meteor from the server / play by yourself (as Beardedbob explains in this YT video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SiY6PwyX38) but at the end of the road i still highly recommend you to start the game of by playing it with others on a multiplayer server - there's so much fun and so much to discover together. You also have to wait for your skill points - you can't just earn them yourself. So you can kind of mod your skill points in but then you're missing out on learning new things like... cooked meat or electricity! After a day of waiting you'll finally be able to learn them and try them out, it's really exciting this way. Especially if you need different resources from all the other players who are skilling into different skill trees. But after all: don't forget to destroy the meteor... and have a blast = fun, haha ;). Greetings Freds00n"
general,Plans for Singleplayer? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1329/plans-for-singleplayer,6999,12,5,ChronosWS,"An active modding community might also be able to address this.  I personally feel like Eco needs to have a core competency and be a great platform for future expansion (MC for example did good on the first and not so good on the second until others came along and kindasorta fixed it.)  One danger for early games is trying to be all things to all people too soon.  Even though I would personally also like to see a challenging and fun single-player experience, I would not want the core experience to be diluted by that additional requirement if it would increase development time or take away from the community experience."
general,Plans for Singleplayer? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1329/plans-for-singleplayer,6999,12,6,evanpage,"In my opinion Single Player would completely undermine the purpose of this game. The whole game has been designed to be played as a community, creating a single player experience out of that would require a total overhaul of almost all of the mechanics and skill progression. While somewhere way down the line this could be viable, it seems like it would be a waste of time at this stage. Maybe some sort of practice creative mode or tutorial could satisfy this need? But as for the main gameplay it wouldn't really fit within the context of the game."
general,Plans for Singleplayer? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1329/plans-for-singleplayer,6999,12,7,GrimReaper411,"Looking it as a game and yet a teacher of simple world economics, Single Player would bring a different use of mechanics. Yes it would have to change a huge amount of things for Single Player to actually be like multiplayer, but maybe my idea for that can make a difference. Since in multiplayer there are only few players, maybe make an NPC, or a few that will look up to you and require your commands. For example, NPC1 can be a cook/hunter. So you send him off for (x)in-game hours to farm animals/crops. NPC2 can be your blacksmith. Have him focus, which you choose what he focuses, blacksmith properties. NPC3 can be your engineer. Or however you want your NPCs to be. Maybe create a menu for your specifications, but for the NPCs, you can control their abilities just as if your friends where there in the world. Some things would have to change for the player, but not as much. You would still have things being built, farmed, in progress, all whilst doing what you chose to do. It wouldn't be the same as with friends, but it would be close enough, and Single Player."

I didn't realize it and leave it on, today on the first restart that automatically happened (Server is 2 days old) caused the server to reset itself and erase every progress.

So If I download the files for the current one listed on the eco account website and then install that version for myself and others to play on, what changes were made to that version over the last version I did.  Did it fix some of the bugs, did it add more content.  Where oh where can I go to find this information.  It should be posted on your forums for all to see, just like every other game does. For Instance, the first version of 6.0 I played on allowed me to chop down trees, dig holes, mine ore/stone however when I placed my workbench it was unusable.  Several days later, a newer, updated version of 6.0 is out, I download it, fire it up and start to try it out.  Now the Workbench is usable and I can craft things. Again having a place to go to be able to read what things have changes, bugs fixed etc....is huge.  Please add this to the forums, or tell me where I can easily find this information. Thanks"

The different version are just a way to update your client. They are not meant to pick and choose from.
They give access to staging because the more bug testers the better. But staging versions are full of bugs and are not really meant to be played seriously on. The devs are not going to give you the list of the changes per ""staging versions"" Because not only it's work but they have absolutely no use of you playing an older staging version. If you want to play staging 0.6 you should update to the last one everyday. That way you can help find bugs. And you get to see by yourself what's new."

We have patch notes for our stable builds. Though as @Mog has mentioned already staging builds are daily builds almost. Patch notes are both hard and sort of pointless. You cant really guaranty that a bug was actually fixed. That is what the staging builds is for. to test fixes, and bugs.  As a developers though new versions can be only tested for a short time without a dedicated QA team ( that is quite costly). A playerbase that also can test those thinks is actually allot better then a QA team. But again it would be sort of pointless to invest time to create daily patch notes for a patch that is most likely be not completely true or that is already outdated in less then 24 hours. Staging builds are basically really broken builds anyway. and work in progress. It is not practical in general to create patch notes for those fast updates. I hope you get what i try to say =)"

And in most ways you are 'sleeping' when your not online.  You continue to gain skill points but you are not really in game - as in being seen by other players/animals etc.  If sleep was added as something you did while in game it would really need to do something for you - like apply to stats or something.  That would mean doing a bunch of re-coding and adding in a system for sleep and its benefits and then balance that out with food etc. Since you are physically not in the game when logged off nothing can affect you.  Besides animals do not attack. 2 There is no player death, you cannot starve or be killed"

I noticed pollution spreading in the form of discolored grass and trees, so I checked the forum here and saw that I needed to bury the tailings within stone to dispose safely. I've done this, but problem is pollution is still spreading from the stockpile where the tailings were originally stored - there are no more tailings there so I'm confused why this is happening.  I don't think there's anything else there that would cause this (I didn't notice pollution at all until I started smelting) It's too soon to say if the tailings underground are still causing pollution to spread, but this stockpile is far away from the original.  Any idea what is happening here?"

The Tailings really need to be buried deeply in Stone (i dig till i got at least 3 layers of stone above the Stockpiles) without any rubble nearby. Depending on how strong the pollution already was, it should take 24-48h till it's gone if there are no more tailings around. Maybe try to clear the stockpile and place it again if you're sure there is no other problem with them. Maybe you missed some Tailings at a stockpile nearby? Btw. it really looks very devastating even with ""only"" 1 % Pollution. Meanwhile it could already be solved for you :)"

I can only conclude that there is a time lag where pollution will continue to spread, even after the source has been removed and then it takes a long time to recover. Well, I've removed the original stockpile, double checked for hidden tailings, removed the bloomery but the pollution is still spreading over a larger area :( I noticed on the map screen there was a filter for ground pollution but strangely this doesn't show anything "

There's more eco players then we are seeing online but all playing with there own community friends, and this is causing a lot of spread.
cause of the spread server get to inactive and those people stop playing again waiting for new update to start a new round hoping for more players. I think to get a few more succesful game round of the ground, less servers and more players playing together on less servers would make the game more active, ive stopped playing on my community servers after a day or 5 cause there was nobody else to play with. pretty hard to reduce the amount of servers, as community's like to have there own server online.

From my experience it's more about finding a stable server where the admin is playing a lot. I went through lots of servers where the admin wasn't there and well.. When the server is stuck you can't play. As simple as that. Then there is the fact that people don't like to join servers more than 5 days old. Not fun to be far behind in SP.

It is at 0.5 by default, if you change it to 0, no more hanging blocs next time you generate your world. You can also change it directly in the server files, in Configs/WorldGenerator.eco, find the line that says ""OverhangChance"": 0.5, and change the number to 0.0 That's all folks.

In the forum emerges more and more spam, with ominous links which is not removed.
On Kickstarter starting from 250K no further Stretch Goals are specified.
There are more and more bugs from version to version, there will be more, but none will be removed, there will be no fixes.
Things that had a texture in 5.5 still have no texture in 5.6. I mean, this is all very confusing, even in an alpha. And is it easy to get the impression ECO is dead or just a joke, right? And is really going to Steam. Sorry but this is suicide, the steam commumnity is merciless. And do not misunderstand me, I love ECO. I'm slightly confused because of all this."

However i do agree, the lack of Mods and Dev activity in the forum and extremely long stretched project has begun to bring into question what is really going on. Strange-loop is developing other things at the same time so there is a good chance they are busy with something else or they are using this to fund stuff. All that could be true or it could be false, we will never know because sadly Developers are no longer transparent and it is the consumers fault. We allow companies to release Alphas and Betas while we throw money at them expecting the impossible to appear over night due to our need for instant gratification. This has forced developers to be secretive and elusive, all the while allowing them to either develop a great game or horde money because we keep throwing it at them. That being said, i did pay to support them 2 years ago, and have greatly enjoyed what we have so far. Even so much that I pay for a server to enjoy it with others.

From the few videos I've seen, if you prefer the ""solo"" experience, you wouldn't have enough skill points to be able to specialize in enough skills to survive in the game.  If this isn't true, then all's well.  If it is, then ""solo"" play isn't really viable. Thank you for your time.  :)"

Also if you are diverting water for a farm you are in for another suprice.

Often you can get your shovel back by doing the following: Go to your cart, focus the top frame of it (not the handle bars) and press ""E"" to open it. Also you could build yourself a new cart, place it beneathe the stuck one, focus the top frame of the new one, press ""E"", click on ""storage"", link the old one to the new one and transfer the stuff from the old to the new one, then take your shovel out of the new one."

The furnace, wherever it is, would have to be vented. I would think even more so underground then just on the surface in a  building.  You can't run a furnace that puts off smoke and particulate matter and just hold it underground with you - you would die.  SO it would have to be vented to the outside and into the air and so would be air pollution in either case.  Even if there were massive air purifiers and recyclers that filtered and cleaned the air, you would still have to remove gases and send those gases somewhere.

So, like a smart cookie I came here first to find out how they should be stored, and yet I have found conflicting advice in the threads. In one thread it says to ""store them in a stockpile surrounded on all sides by ""stone that has NOT been picked"" place the stockpile inside and link it to the bloomery. Now call me crazy but that is 100% impossible to achieve. You cannot hollow out the 5x5x5 space inside without making atleast a doorway into the room to make space for the stockpile. At least 2 stones would have to be mined in this scenario. Another thread says a 5x5x5 stockpile, surrounded by mortered stone, surrounded by dirt. While this seems easy to do, and what I would expect to work, another thread states that doing this led to ground pollution seeping out. So then, what do we do? You can't make a room in un-cut stone without cutting at least 2 stones to get inside, and if mortered stone covered in dirt also leaks, then we're at a loss here."

I may make a wiki entry as well to help folks out. my next experiment shall be on nutrient draw based on which plants as well as increasing various nutrient levels over time.  any feedback or ideas would be greatly appreciated going forward. thanks for reading, share your tips/tricks.  anyone with fertilizer experience would be appreciated.  I'll answer any questions folks have to the best of my abilities and I hope others will do the same."

It seems if a plant is at stage 3 you can jump stages by removing and replacing the adjacent block of dirt. This has worked for me several times even if the plant is not fully mature. I have removed adjacent untilled soil, and replaced it with fresh dirt. This seems to help in the growing phase of the dirt. Also I have experienced that moving previously fertilized dirt helps increase the yield with the tilled dirt. I plan on doing a series with this portion of the game as soon as I buy a capture card for my laptop."

I have my fields separated by dirt roads to make my life easier.  every single plot that was not regenerating nitrogen/moisture is now on it's way to recovery now that the rest of the field that it's a part of is cleared of other plants.  seems to be that turning the dirt doesn't do much, but ensuring that the fields (not just individual plots) are going fallow.  like I said this is working on each and every one of the plots with immediate results (like I checked before harvesting, and after and immediately after harvest they began recovery) this is even on plots that I had left tilled that were not recovering initially, so there's that folks"

I'm impressed with the way you make sense of these grids. My own experimentation has given much more erratic results. Something that you probably have noticed,  but that haven't been mentioned yet,  is that beans actually enrich the soil with nitrogen instead of taking it away. Pretty cool feature mimicking real life! This should mean that once you have access to the higher tier fertilizer giving potassium and phosphate you can eliminate the need for nitrogen fertilizer by co-planting and/or crop-rotating with beans. Another thing that hasn't been discussed is the fact that you can make farms that extend vertically in multiple layers by making a scaffolding of logs etc. It seems like each layer adds it's drain to the plot effectively doubling the drain for a 2 layer farm. This additive behavior might be good if co-planting beans on one of the layers though..."

(https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1benxXkSXGyAf_UWlI5IUwXsGmk8-7yKzaFEd-8xS2sk/edit?usp=sharing) I have tested co-planting and crop rotating but no success as no matter how you do it, it's always a drain on the land. Beans do not offset it by enough to warrant doing this. I have large fields, over 200 blocks each. And i have 2x for each crop. I leave one Fallow for 24hrs whilst I use the other one then switch. But i have noticed that planting more than 1 yield of the crop within 24hrs drains the land so badly that it takes much longer to recover. Leading me to believe that large crop fields are not a good idea and that i should be using 10x fields for each crop but on a much smaller scale, planting in the next one as I harvest. For example -
Wheat - Time to Maturity 4hrs (example)
Plant in 8x8 Field, Harvest, Plant in next field.
Do this 6 times to reach 24hrs to be able to go back to the original field and start again. Theoretically that would work but as we know maturity time is wildly different depending on conditions. Also i tried using Hide Ash Fertilizer on a fallow field i was leaving to recover and my result was that it affects the Base Values by the same as the tooltip. But in turn only changed predicted Nitrogen level by 1.9. --- Values before --- N - C25.6, P25.8, D0.5, B24
Ph - C51.7, P51.9, D0.5, B49.1
Pt - C50.5, P50.7, D0.5, B47.4 --- Values after 1x Hide Ash Fertilizer --- N - C25.6, P27.7, D0.5, B29
Ph - C51.7, P51.9, D0.5, B49.6

In combination with things like elk taco or smth with extra carb i would probably get even more SP a day. Unfortunately our server crashed and probably lost the save file because i would've been making bear supreme + pie today... which was my basic plan after all because they are very balanced indeed and very nutritious (both 1.500). Problem with elk willington is it's high protein or fat (170) which means you kind of have to balance this out again. So my guess is to try pie and supreme first for the balanced values in both. I've just started today with 150ish SP a day again (with my previous diet i've posted here) and i hope i'll be back on track asap to try even more combinations. :) I'm not sure why but it seems that - especially with wild mix combo (which has camas bulb in general) ingrediënts with camas bulb might also give more sp a day for some reason? Because sausage + mix obv. gives way more SP a day according to thread but this is smth i'd love to test out one day. Tier 4  vegie,baking: Huckleberry pie Tier 3 meat, culinary: + Sausage (+ Elk taco or change sausage with elk taco - needed testing, diet needs carbs.) gives about 280 - 300(+) SP.

Think elk wellington just doesn't do it for now. Or maybe you can use it as a cheaper alternative since it's only prep. meat and flour, in terms of commercialisation. Just like i'm cooking pie and taco for everyone (cheaper) and probably Bear grillz meat + wild mix for a specific circle of players who can afford it. Taco is like 1 - 1 per meat you get, pie is like double the berries you need. Then recipes like grillz meat and wild mix are probably the same as pie bcs berries are such a burden to gather. You kind of need afk food (the good stuff) and labor food (placeholder food with lots of cal and easy to prep) - especially if you still want good SP/day while doing labor, it'll be sort of expensive if you just eat a lot of grillz meat and wild mix ya' know, especially if you're a commercial cook like me, trying to share the successes of your cooking with the server."

general,Prickly Pears? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2598/prickly-pears,2257,6,4,rentechd,"Well, all i can think is that you got unlucky on your world generation and got a lousy prickly pear count.  Actually i would report that on github (see the how to report bug thread in bug reports topic  in support category as a bug) because the game generation should give you at least one prickly pear so I would let the devs know that a world can be generated without any, there might be an edit to the configuration that need to be made to make sure that the minimum of at least 1 is set so you don't have a world without pears.  Its possible that some could show up later on but I would check and see if you ended up with a   world without the biome that they spawn in and that is why you have  none.  If you don't have that biome the only solution is to start a  new world and get one with the biome available"

general,Prickly Pears? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2598/prickly-pears,2257,6,6,rentechd,Yeah.  I would make a bug report on github and then give it a few days and see if you get any that sprout up.  If not and you need them (they are not really needed for much) you may have to restart or just live without them for now until the devs look at the issue and get a fix in a patch.    As long as their is the right biome for them to grow though they should eventually sprout some unless that is bugged too

The pollution form tailings should not have covered half your map in 5 minutes.  If so you have the game speeded up or something else is wrong.- it takes a great deal longer to get pollution creep out of a tailing block  to hit even 10 blocks from center (at least a game day).

cpu Q9550, will peform a litle slower then the I3-4130, but the game is not very cpu demanding as it only uses 30% on my i5-2500k. So its save to asume that your good on the cpu. Gtx 660 ti, is almost as fast as gtx950. so no difrence there i would say.
only part that is a bit low is the ram, 4gb it would work but its on the edge,
im running the game + win7 and use around 4.5gb and 2.5gb is reserved for the game, but if you only have 4gb windows will free up some of the memory, so the game still would have enoug. But hounest opinion, i think 4gb ram is a risk in performance depending what direction the game is going to develop in. Graphic options: all slider style
Graphic quality: 6 setings, the determen shadow and light quality.
Foliage Quality: Smooth slide, determens grass/tree quality.
Render Scale: % based to reduce resolution pixels rendered.
Field of view: character view.
View Distance: 30 to 150
minimap Details: how detailed minimap is when you have it opened. it runs very heavy.
interface scale: % based. This are all the options there are at the moment.
if you would run the game i would geus this would be your options. -> Graphic options: all slider style

Foliage Quality: 1/4
Render Scale: 100% - 1920*1080
Field of view: default is 74
View Distance: 30-60 depending on amount of buildings.

general,Tailings :O | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2550/tailings-o,8955,14,4,toxxikz,"Actually many companies are now finding it easier to reuse the tailings.  In response to concerns over tailings dam failures and water contamination, some mines are opting to produce thickened tailings, which are pressed or have chemicals added to remove excess water. Thickened tailings can be mixed with cement and used in construction or as backfill in underground mines. The run off of tailings can be bad because of the chemicals used in the process are kept in the tailings.  Once the tailings have been used to create cement the chemicals are then inert and become safe for use in construction.  I would like to see this incorporated into the cement making process, could be a truly realistic and environmental friendly way to dispose of tailings.  Granted tailings are not required to make cement, so I would suggest maybe having another recipe added to utilize them in a process to make cement and not change the current process.  Yes I understand this will create two recipes for making the same thing, but the one with the tailings could use more stone and therefor make it less efficient but also make it more ecological friendly by utilizing the process to remove waste from the world, much like is being done in real life.  You could also require coal or charcoal be used in the recipe as it appears this is a neutralizing agent used to help neutralize the chemicals found in tailings in real life as well."

general,5.6 | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2556/5-6,665,1,1,Julia_Starfire,"So I picked the game back up again after waiting for the update. I'm pretty impressed with the linked storage. It's a nice shortcut to getting things moving and done a lot faster then having to keep running back and forth or stacking trunk space ontop of one another just to be able to toggle the windows. The stock pile storage however is a little annoying in terms of it taking up a massive amount of space on your land and taking up room for farming or housing. What would be cool to do is if it were to made to look like some part of maybe an outside trunk like looking thing? Maybe something close to what a compost pit would look like or just barrels that rest along side houses instead of a large open padded area where wood, dirt, stone and sand can be stacked. The farming part is pretty glitchy and very slow in process. I do actually really love how the skills are set up. Where what you know branches off into sections and what you don't know is highlighted in grey. That actually makes it fairly easier to figure out where to go next in the game. The graphics look great and everything else seems a lot better though there are still little buggy issues here and there. I'm looking forward to getting more into the game again."

You would have to change the name on your Eco account.  I am not sure if they are going to allow people to request that as it would get crazy with people wanting to change names.

general,Servers going offline. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2460/servers-going-offline,5501,14,5,rentechd,"Julia_Starfire One of the great things about playing an game still in alpha is that you get in early and get to see the game develop and change.  The down side is, and people are warned, that game play can be interrupted, that you can lose things and have to restart worlds, that there will be crashes and things that do not work yet, or work as they are supposed to or are even finished yet and so on.  People get excited about jumping into an alpha to be 'the first to play the game' but often don't consider that playing an alpha can be a very frustrating experience.  This is not the fault of the person running the server and it happens to everyone.  Its something to expect and understand will happen.    Developers try to do the best to kept the game as stable as possible but when new things are being added and major game changes are taking place things like world corruption and the fact that a world will no longer work when there is a version change are just things that happen with playing an alpha game.  This is why we tell people that is an alpha game and what to expect and if having to restart multiple times, lose all the hard work you have done and advancement you make is a frustration to you, that its then best to wait and buy the game once its fully released and the chances of this happen are very small.   Everyone playing this game at this point has this issue.  And this is an issue that will continue while the game is in alpha.  Once its released on Steam and is in ""beta"" chances are less that new versions will require world starts and that you will hit bugs that corrupt the world and force you to restart but even then it will not be a guarantee.  If this is too frustrating it might be better to put the game aside for a while and come back to it when its in beta or fully release and these things are not a matter of course.  Alpha 5.6 is due out shortly and it will require a new world to be started.  It will have bugs and crash and have to have updates to fix the big issues so the sever can run again and things will be very rocky at first.  I have some people on my server that have played 5.5.4 since it was out and made a lot of headway who have said that they are 'taking a break' over the first week or so after we update to 5.6 so that they don't have to deal with crashes and downtime and restarts and I can respect that - we will send them a email when its stable for a few days and then they will come back.  We have had a couple of people just decided to put the game away and come back once it releases on Steam and we respect that too - like you they were not prepared for what 'alpha' meant and  once they got a taste of it decided that restarting a great deal was not enjoyable for them and, although they loved the game when they could play they decided to wait and love it without having to start over many times. Its your choice of course, but restarting is not an issue that can avoided by a server admin or the developers and its an issue that everyone playing an alpha game has to deal  with - there is no 'fix' for it - except to wait for the game to progress in development and reach a stage where restarts and wipes are not the norm."
general,Servers going offline. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2460/servers-going-offline,5501,14,6,Julia_Starfire,I think I'll wait to try it again when the update gets released. This really is the first game I've ever tried in alpha and I do enjoy it a lot. Just pulling my damn hair out with having to restart over and over. I keep getting closer and closer to gaining all the skill books then I lose it.
general,Servers going offline. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2460/servers-going-offline,5501,14,7,Grapeseed30124,"For me, running a local server took the following.  1) download the EcoServer package from the same place as you downloaded the game client. 2) Unpack it somewhere (I have both the client and the server unpacked on my desktop, 'unpack' means to right-click it and select extract).  3) Open the unpacked folder and double-click EcoServer.exe.
I don't think I even had to configure anything.  Two server windows will pop up after step 3, wait a few minutes for the world to generate, then when you start Eco, your server should be right there on top.  One potential issue is that the server runs in real time, so if your computer sleeps or shuts down for the night, so will the server and world. Also, the server has a second window with lots of tabs.  One of those lets you postpone or eliminate the meteor, in case you are into that :) Good luck!
p.s. There is probably a better description of this process on the Wiki or Eco home page.  Hunt around for it!"

And there are bugs that happen that cause a world to have to be restarted and so on.  This can be frustrating to people that are trying to 'complete' the game and never get there cause something happens.  Even if she picks a server that is up 24/7, does not have a meteor that will destroy it in 30 days and force it to start over or has people that plan to keep the server around that does not mean that you won't restart.  No one can promise that a world will not bug out an get corrupt or that all updates will work with every update and so on.  For some people that is the downside of alpha and they just can't deal with it over the long term and find it happier to wait until the game is at a place where that is not as likely to happen at all."

It's the frustration of coming closer to gaining all the skill books, not exactly completing the game because I don't think this game as a completion stage at all, and being forced to restart. Every server will be forced to restart if not to fix bug issues but also with updates. That's what sucks. If we were somehow able to keep the skills we learn and carry them over to the next new server I'd be happy to keep starting over again and again. But then I guess there wouldn't be much of a challenge in that to some. I've met a lot of awesome people in this game that we've all worked together to learn skills together fast enough to meet the dreaded dooms day on day 30 in every server, it's just my own personal satisfaction in learning all the skills that isn't being met. That's whats ticking me off."

There have been many 'admin' tools written by modders and I wonder if one could be written that would  give an Admin a way to transfer player stats from one update to the next - save in one and then replace after the update.  That may not work all of the time ,  say if player status or skills were changed in someways that just would not let the save be restored after an update or if the admin would have to wait for the modder to update the mod to work with a newer version.

Would spawning in the correct books help Julia's situation?  Maybe not, on a populated server the skill books will exist, but she won't have the skill points to use them.  Could one possibly mod a super-food to catch up with?  If so, that would solve the skill point problem without having to figure out how to transfer character data.

But the Admin only gave 5 due to it being around the holidays and wouldn't give anymore. Which is fine to. It was a nice kick start to getting caught up and continuing. We were well on our way to getting pumps going and making plastic before the server was shut down.

It currently feels like the game is set around building what you need for skills and workbenches and racing towards the higher tier technologies, but what happens when you have built and researched everything? I guess I am feeling that there is nothing to achieve until you have enough skill points for the next technology and I feel like there needs to be something that can only be achieved while actively playing the game. I compare the game frequently to EVE, where in EVE you can spend time getting skills, but if you never log in, you will have no money to purchase anything.

Basically the current 'plan' is to make one guy the head chef, let him spec in cooking a couple of days, cook awesome late-game food and pretty much everyone can skill up whatever they want... or at least that is how i experienced the current state of the game. In the beginning everyone worked together so well, but in the end you had so many skill points that you can easily spec into other skill trees, which made certain jobs redundant - making players do even less. The economy part of the game is very important, especially since you can't promote active play by passive skill point gain. You're reliable on those jobs like road building and making certain goods. We sure did a lot of road building which sure was a lot of fun (we dug two tunnels through two mountains - it took 2 IRL days lol) but the late-game is just too much 'all over the place' right now. Once players can sort of 'claim' an actual job; like being a cook, carpenter, blacksmith,.. and maintain this role for a very long time without being able to instantly spec into other skill trees, that would promote more active play imo; and especially teamwork. After all that's what the game is all about - everyone works together to destroy the meteor and maintain the current (and good) state of the planet. This was the reward we had for a certain amount of time and it was great helping each other out. Very important skills like farming are a much needed trait because i've also noticed that (especially blueberries) are rare, same with been bushes and such. There's only one forest who has them en mass and farming (or eating/cooking) is a #1 priority in survival. Once greedy players start claiming those bushes, you're pretty much done because there aren't a lot of them to find in the open. It gets even worse if you play actively - you need lots of food to maintain a proper diet. Especially the end-game food needed a lot of blueberries, which caused a little bit of a crisis. I started to think about it and our active community only had 5 players eating from my stock, which isn't even a lot of players. Of course this is a work in progress as i've heard. It will be fixed in 5.5. That's also my last point; it's an alpha. The game isn't finished yet and nobody can really use the term 'playing'. It's more or less 'testing' and 'reporting bugs', rather then playing. Always keep this in mind. I'm actively involved in a lot of EA titles on steam and also games like eco, which aren't on steam yet. A lot of the new developers listen carefully and appreciate bug reports/suggestions a lot which is one of the things i actively support them with. That's also the thing you're supposed to do imo. Beside reporting bugs you can have some fun with road building or have a giggle at flying carts (haha), whatever you like the most. More content will be added and the current systems will be tweaked accordingly. I'm looking forward to 5.5 and will hopefully start testing again very shortly. :) @Johnnyonoes if you subscribe to the newsletter you are able to see new features faster. I received a mail which had video's of 5.5 in it! Not sure about the road map but they do give away new features on FB and mail.https://business.facebook.com/EcoVideoGame/videos/1210050455751622/"

We will post our game dev docs on FB a lot of time too. Great feedback Fred, thats something I've been thinking about myself, if we want to prevent 'skill gods' in later game, and starting to lean towards it.  Perhaps there are some branches in the skill tress where you choose one option, and the other becomes locked off permanently.  Or, it becomes insanely expensive (20,000 skill points) so a single player can still get every skill, but it requires speeding up time. This will be helped a lot by deeper and wider skill systems, and we're hoping to keep expanding that so there's 30 days of continuous skill gain available, and then mods to extend that even further towards infinity, but even on top of that thinking some locking off is necessary. Thanks for the input, definitely helpful as we're actively working on all this stuff."

One of the important aspects of the game is allowing players who have limited time to play to still positively affect the game without feeling completely eclipsed by those who can play for multiple hours a day. That said, the game cannot progress without people being online to horde resources, build infrastructure, and do other time consuming tasks. A server of players who only log on once a day for 10 minutes to eat food will get nowhere and, while the game may not currently reflect this a well as it should, the need for roads, buildings, and farms will cause this to happen. The fact that it doesn't currently is a balance issue, along with the severely chocked early-game skill point gains. I've been pretty restrained in jacking up the prices of constructions (and most of them haven't changed much since 4.0) but that's going to significantly change going forward. There is going to be a huge emphasis placed on efficiency and speed skills to encourage specialization through that rather than simply the ability to perform a task. Not only should this help specialization, but it should give players who are on a lot a bigger reason to gather resources and create means of doing so. I definitely agree there is a flow issue with skill point gain in 5.4 and there is also an issue with all skills (especially lower tier ones) being easy to obtain which ends up producing a scenario where players can learn everything. I do not, however, agree with ever completely locking off a tree to a player, nor do I think even restricting skill points in other trees is a good idea. If the game were to lock off skill trees as you skill some, there are scenarios where players will become so indispensable to the entire server's gameplay that, if said player stopped playing, the game would become unplayable with no method of recovery short of console commands or restarting. If, for example, your cook (a tree which everyone else is now locked out of by virtue of choosing other paths) suddenly decides to stop playing, you've now lost all access to non-primitive food which would stonewall progression significantly. The same can be said for almost any number of roles. Increasing the cost of other skill trees as you place skills is another suggestion that has been made, however this also comes with its own issues. The early portion of the game is meant for players to experiment with different things: hunting, farming, cooking, building, etc. Not everyone spawns into the game knowing they want to cook food for the next X hours of their time in Eco and certainly not everyone wants to just cook food that whole time either. Making tiny uninformed decisions in the early game drastically impact a player's successful later on is something that will drive players to restart. Making it scale with the ""tier"" of skill inhibits late game changes (which are already hampered slightly) causing a situation similar to hard locking skills out, although this is slightly more recoverable. In 5.5 a lot of the skill point gain and resource cost food has been altered significantly to lower the skill gain later in the game and to encourage the efficiency and speed skills. Ideally you can still be a jack-of-all-trades, but the whole ""master-of-none"" will actually be applicable."

I realize this is alpha and some of this is scheduled to be fixed already although I do not know what is in the works specifically. I have a few suggestions but first let me share what my perception has been on how people are playing the game. My experience consists of:
I have played a good amount of time, 100+ hours total on 3 different servers. I have been constently checking the number of playera online on other servers that I do not play on. What people are doing:
Server first starts up and there are 6-20 active people logging in day 1. People are chatting, building their first homes, gathering food, spending SP. There are lots of things to do and it is fun. Then you realize you have spent all your SP, you have built all you can, and you have your food as balanced as you can understand it should be. Everyone starts logging off.
Next few days the more active people will be on more so sometimes in order to setup a few extra buildings, setup a mine, build a few roads but primarily all people balance their food and then log off.
By day 6 it starts to become a ghost town and ther is rarely more than 1 or 2 people on at any given time. What is the problem: My phone is dying. Will post my ideas for solutions from my PC."

Over the last updates /Pre-5.3(coming) performance has been getting fairly worse, too the stage of it is becoming unplayable. My Worry....
The Steam Release is looming, being this year, matter of months - and well, i dont feel like the Developers have ever mentioned about any performance fixes, or let us know that like ""A few weeks in 5.3 will be dedicated too reducing the FPS Required"" - example, I have mentioned it within Facebook, and i feel like it gets ignored, i have seen other players asking if it runs good, and people saying it doesnt run good... With the steam release looming, i actually feel like optimization is a key piece too any good title, especially on steam - being the extremely wide audience of people, with a huge range of different hardware specifications. It could be a side which will let ECO fall - People will just Refund the game, and ECO shall sadly not benefit. Another worry is that, the main purpose of ECO was too provide classrooms a realistic enviromental impact game, which children could play, without affecting real world matters, and potentially learn from this and grow up too be a better human being! - With that paragraph in mind, i do not believe schools have the correct systems with the correct hardware requirements for children to be able to play  this game, which would possible destroy the ""main"" purpose this game was created. I hope you read what i have put, and i am not trying t start fights, destroying a game before it has even released too the public, its just a concern for the classrooms and nearing steam release.

general,"Honest, Concerns and Worries | ECO Forum",https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2478/honest-concerns-and-worries,2509,7,2,rentechd,"First, remember that this is an alpha release.  Traditionally alpha is for getting in the base code and key systems in.  Optimization and performance tuning comes after all systems are in and usually mostly during beta.  When steam release comes the game may not yet be fully into beta and may still be considered 'alpha' and people are warned on steam, like they are here, what an alpha entails and that you cannot expect great performance.    Even steam makes sure users are aware that an Early Access game comes with possible issues and performance might not be that what you expect with a fully released game.  If this was being release on steam as a final release then performance issues would be an problem but as it is now the release will be 'early access' and are aware, or should be aware that this is where the game is at.  they are invited to join early access games to provide feedback and suggestions to development but to be able to get in on the early development of the game they may have to deal with performance issues. As for the school issue, some schools just don't have computers at all, some have very old ones and that is sadly not something that SLG can fix.  I don't think they can develop an game, even an educational game for technology that is decades old just for that reason.  That being said the server will run on a windows 7 desktop and manage to run the game fine for a classroom and the client runs well on macs which seem to be what is in the majority of classrooms.  Once .Net core 2.0 is release they will also be able to run the server on Linux.  Many companies, like mine, that offer Eco servers are providing servers to schools that are adding ECO to their curriculum if they don't have a way to support a server (although most seem to not have a problem doing so so far).  Its not in many classrooms yet but as it gets in more, it will also be into beta and into getting performance fixes so there should be resolution there.  We have several teachers in the local district that have the game, my company gave away copies to several local teachers so they could work with the game and develop a curriculum around it and have been working with it for a couple of months now and have not had a problem running on the equipment they have nor have thy had complaints about performance.  The minimum requirements for the game are not very high and should be doable in most schools.  Sadly there are school districts that do call what they have 'computers' but they decades old because those districts don't support IT in the schools.  I am not sure you can ask a company to dumb down a game to be effective on those systems.  Yes, its sad they won't be able to run the game but its sad they are not able to run any modern day software and are stuck running titles that are decades old and very old technology. I should add that the game has already been released to the public, it was already released on the eco site - you don't have to go on steam to be a 'public' release."

I love the game, and follow its development. Myself im a bit of a pc hardware junkie on a tight budget.
Performance per Buck, and in the current state its true if you dont want to reduce your game play resolution, the game runs pretty heavy.
I dont mind this as its a difficult process creating a game like this, on a low budget with only a few staff members, but depending what kinda audience you want to reach performance could be very important. But i have to say the games does run on 720p with every thing on low, on a low end video card.
But with the expectations of people playing the game,at home or on schools. every thing on low wont satisfy the users.
the game looks decent on 1080p with graphics at medium view distance medium. not great but decent,
Its a very raw game at the moment, functional i would say but not very pleasing on the eyes, if you dont know what kinda game your getting into. But to play the game at 1080p, medium settings, the average pc wont be powerful enough, most new pc's have a Intel I3, or AMD cpu that's about the same speed and that is enough for eco, but the game runs very heavy on its gpu and most people with low budget, laptop, or potentially using eco at a education facility wont have the gpu power to run the game decently, in its current state. This post is just a confirmation to the post made by @DonkeySurvivalist
and not ment as criticism, quick summary:
1: the game is in alpha, so i have no expectations in any aspect, and every development is a surprize ;)
2: gameplay: The basics is done and looks good and promising.
3: Performance: On a game pc it runs, decent to good. - pc systems with a gpu cheaper then 125$ from 2017 and the game runs bad.
For a alpha game published to small public its good so far, If the game would be released on steam in its current state, i feel it would do more damage then good. cause of the heavy gpu requirements in its current state."

Some educational software is going to have to be released for the schools that do... we can't all keep making 2d games.  At some point schools will upgrade but won't have modern software to run if developers are forced, still now, to create games so that a school using a Wildcat II 5110 can run the game. :) Yes, this means some schools won't be able to run ECO and that is sad,  but perhaps as more software comes out for schools that push the school to buy better computers for the classroom that will benefit the kids.  The GPU tech for this game is over 5 years old and it does run fine on a GTX660."

My older computer is using a first gen I5 2.2ghz processor with 4 gigs of ram and a GTX 750ti that i bought on sale on newegg for 89 dollars .... most of the time the game with all of the settings about medium runs just fine, i do get a little lag now and then but not bad, now on my newer computer running dual 1080ti well with everything on high it is smoking fast. Now that being said the game is in alpha phase still, and there will obviously be some tuning down the road, but to get the game out there its at good specs right now for what is on the market....My high school back in 1994 when i graduated had good computers, every 3 years they updated their computers to keep up with the latest software that was out, many high schools do this. If this is used at the college level which I could easily see happening, well then there really shouldn't be a problem as most students are required to provide their own computers.  I agree some schools don't or won't upgrade computers.... but the hard fact is that the average computer should be able to run this game just fine with a decent GPU.... as far as computers with integrated graphics I haven't attempted it yet but I do have an older computer in my garage i could try this weekend. The other factor to keep in mind is that for schools its about learning not about the game looking as great as it can, running the game on low to medium settings if that is all they are capable of would still accomplish this.  Also please remember that a school is most likely going to contact the Dev team and make sure their computers can support this game before making such a purchase and trying to add it to their classes.  I have many friends that are teachers that I have shown the game to, and one of them has already had their budget adjusted for next year to allow for the purchase of 10 new computers so that they can support this game and other software they would like to use.  So in a way not only will this game be used as a good teaching tool, but it has also provided her a reason to get upgraded computers in her school..... and getting upgraded computers in the schools is always a win. Also a couple of teachers i know are working with a local computer shop that may donate computers to the school so while there are limitations, there are also good hearted people out there that will find a way."

I suppose, all that is left too be said is lets hope, John K and his excellent team of Developers finish this game successfully and work through increasing how it runs and push it out too schools too hopefully fulfill the games purpose, and provide information onto children of the future on how to build there self a better world!"
general,"Honest, Concerns and Worries | ECO Forum",https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2478/honest-concerns-and-worries,2509,7,7,rentechd,"Actually this topic spawned a very long discussion last night about this in discord.  We really can't keep asking software developers to develop tools with requirements of only hardware that is a decade or more out of date.  Sure they could do a ECO game in 2D with minimal graphics requirements and such so that 'deprived' schools could run the game but then who is going to write software for the schools that do have more modern equipment and what happens when the deprived schools get more handme does and can run better software and everyone is stuck running very out of date software because people insisted that developers only develop educational software for the lowest common denominator.  I think instead of putting error into telling developers they are doing a disservice to education or pushing them to code towards older standards that effort should go towards educating school districts and boards out there and showing them what more modern software looks like if they would make the hardware available. You would really be surprised how much it is about the game looking as good as it can.  You may have a 'disadvantaged' school that can't afford to step into this decade, but believe the kids know.  They know old software from new and good graphics from bad and can actually be vert tough critics. The answer is getting the schools to adjust budgets to get the hardware that will  support software written for this decade.  And actually no school even needs to get a 'new computer' to run Eco.  They got those 10 new computers because they needed 10 new computers - if it was just for Eco they could have spend the same money and gotten 30 5-7 year old used computers for the same price and run ECO fine.  But the point is that this is what needs to happen, school districts, tax payers, whatever need to step up and buy computers that will run modern software not whine to developers that they need to dumb down their code or use ancient graphics so they don't have to have computers created this decade. And yes there will be some schools that can't get the software because they can't/won't get the hardware that will run it and while that is too sad, that is the way things work and if that need to change the the effort needs to go to there - fixing the problem there not putting on the software developer.  Same goes with the cost of the software.  Again some teachers/schools are not going to find it in their budget but that does not mean that its the game publishers fault or that they should lose money or cover the cost out of their pocket or that they should not even cover their costs and 'give' the software away. Also, remember that its not all about education also.  The fact that its a crossover and is played as an entertainment game and people buy it as such does help cover the development cost so the overall price can be lower for schools.  Put you can't just say to your entertainment customers ""Oh sorry we are doing 20 year other graphics but its is primarily an educational game and so it has to run on very old gpus because schools won't buy new computers"".  That won't fly far, nor should it."

But as I keep trying to convince my friends to get it, one question/concern keeps coming up. ""You have to have a large number of other players!"" Or ""you can not just play with one or two other people."" So to my question: I realize there is like 5-6 categories of skills and such. How specialized do you end up at the ""end game"" or ""max level"" or what ever it is called. Will I only be able to max one skill tree or will I be able to max 2-3? Will I be able to have points across some of the lower tiers of trees while still being able to max a tree? If I want to build structures, will that literally be the only thing I can do while playing? I am just curious to have much I can do? Thank you for any feedback, if you need my to clear up anything. I am more than happy to do that.

general,How specialized are you? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2431/how-specialized-are-you,1362,3,3,toxxikz,"@Prongs I can say the game can be played solo or with friends, either way.  I do agree with @Ravnster it will take longer playing solo, but me personally I tried to convince my friends that play minecraft to come play but they just wont until its finished.  So here is what I have done.  I have setup a server running here at my house that I play on solo, but at the same time there are many public servers with great communities and I also play on one or two of them at a time.  I really enjoy both aspects of the game, solo play and community play.  I have already made many new friends just from playing this game.  So if your wondering if you have to have friends to play, no you don't it can be soloed, but playing with people can also be very fun and rewarding, but even if your friends don't play you can still find public servers and fully enjoy the community play style."

general,Worth $40? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2310/worth-40,4942,19,2,rentechd,"Hi there I bought the game back several versions ago and I play it pretty consistently, so its been well worth it for me.  I have a lot of friends that play it with me and we have been through a few meteors and keep coming back for more. That said this is in alpha and if you are not an ""alpha"" game type person then just walk away until its in beta and on steam.  If you can understand what an alpha is and that there will be bugs; that gameplay may change; and that not all content is in yet but you like to try things out early and like to be part of the feedback to a game of what is working for gameplay - what you would like to see added and so on then its worth it.    But you will have to be prepared that sometihng you liked about the game might get removed or changes even when seeing things you did not like getting changed to a way you are happy with.  The game is evolving as we play it so you have to be ready to accept change.  You also have to accept the fact that its possible you will hit a bug big enough to force the world you are playing on to be reset and so on (although that doesn't happen that much anymore).  You do get a chance to get access to ""staging"" or test builds even before they are declared stable if you really like the testing aspect of being in an alpha.  Many people that say the game is not worth it have the problem that it really is a community based game, not something you can take home and play and win on your own.  There is no ""single player"" mode so to speak, although you can put up your own server and play by yourself if you want.  You will need to play online with a community to get the most out of the experience and quite a few people bought the game without paying attention to that and then were disappointed.  And many people bought it and then discovered what alpha meant and had expected a finished game.  Also some of those reviews are several versions old and a great deal more is in the game as, well, several new versions have come and gone.  The game is definately worth $40 dollars to me and I continue to buy copies for friends."

Is the game worth it, that a hard question it depends what you expect, Il tell you my experience, ive got the game for 30$ cause a few of my community members wanted to play it so we got the 4pack that gave a little discount, My expectations for the game in its current state where not very high as i knew it was very early alpha and i already played a bit of the game before getting my own acount. Ive played the game in rounds meaning every big update of the game we started on a fresh server, my first round ive hade around 110 hours of game play out of it over a time period of 22 days ive played it pretty active, my second round was on a new update, but only a few things where new to me and ive played around 35 hours over a time period of 30 days, and my latest round im mostly inactive as i know most of the game, im waiting for the game to get some new mayor updates, and then il play again, or wait even a bit longer so there it a lot more to explore and its a lot of fun again. My best experience of the game i hade was the first round every thing new, i hade the luck i hade a great team of people to play with, lots of team work, some laughs on discord. So my opinion is for me the 30$ was definitely worth it, but i knew what to expect, and ive played a total of 150 hours for those 30$, and it will be more but that will be in time as the game develops it could take a year or more before the game is fully released who know ;), Ive encountered, lots and lots of bugs, and ive encountered lots and lots of bug fixes by the developers since ive played the game, so i would say there doing a great job. If your up for a game that not finished, and like to be part of the whole process of seeing how the game changes, both good changes and changes you might not like, i would buy it. If you expect a game that works flawless, and has a good endgame better wait, till its in more developed state. Hope this helps,
Greetings Zaskersky,"

You place these down on the areas you want to build on and this ""claims"" the land for you.  You get a deed that then you can control the property with granting access to others individually if you wish - or not at all.  If you build on claimed land people cannot harm your building.  People expect that if the land is unclaimed and they find a building on it it is not wanted anymore because of the fact that the land is not claimed and that what is there is free for the taking.  In many ways you can't blame them for taking your wall or hurting your house or say its a bad server for that.  You did not claim the land or they would not have been able to do this.  As far as anyone knew that land was not claimed and that the resources could just be taken.  If you build on any server and don''t claim the land this will happen to you - even on the best and nicest server in the world.

Its not the server's fault or the admins if the player does not claim the land.  This could and will happen on any server you go on  - if you don't claim the land you build on - whether cause you were tired or you did not have claim flags - it tells other people that that stuff is not owed by anyone and is free to be taken.  That is NOT GRIEFING toxxikz.  That is why tehir are claim flags. No server admin can be online 7/24 to watch your property.  The way to protect property is built into the game in the manner of claim flags.  Its not the servers' fault, or the admin's, or other people playing on that server if your leave your land and building unclaimed.  If you had claimed it they could not have damaged it - the game would have prevented that from happening. Its unfair to start labeling a server as one that is griefing people or is a bad server because what happens is part fo normal gameplay.  Actually on some servers, to keep space open, if a SA finds a building on unclaimed land they will take it down themselves to free up space,   Its not fair to blame a server as being 'bad' because the player failed to take the normal game mechanism steps to protect their property.  Its not up to other players to read minds and  think ""Oh yes, in every other situation where a building is on unclaimed lands its just available for recycle in this case I am getting a telepathic message that the guy was too tired to be bothered to put down claim flags so we should not clean this seemingly abandoned property up...."""

general,Worst people i have ever played with | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2390/worst-people-i-have-ever-played-with,3463,12,12,ChillBilly,"This is a common thing. For the more ""full-time"" players, an unclaimed building is fair game for resources. The issue is many new players will join a server, place down a hut, cut down several trees to build said hut, then collectively mine and destroy wild life in an area for a short time, then never come back. The way the players see your stuff is fair game. They aren't going to cut down trees when they can farm the resources from your house. They aren't going to kill animals when you have already killed and stored most of them. It is what it is, protect your stuff. Secondly, it is not the fault of the server, nor the server admins for not explaining this. It is your responsibility to take this as a lesson learned and grow from it. We do not  have near as many griefers as people think. We are al in this together."
general,My Thoughts of the Excavator.. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2394/my-thoughts-of-the-excavator,1524,1,1,ChillBilly,"So I have a couple of servers running now. One is a 5.6 server with the first test build, which runs great on our regular game server. The other is to test the latest and greatest 5.6 test builds. So as that goes, I have tested and played with our new excavator (without sound, as I am sure has been reported). Pros:
The excavator is great for digging large holes quickly.
The excavator has great mobility with semi good controls.
Turning is easy once a tool is equipped.
It's relatively easy to figure out.
Dumping is easily achieved.
Cons:
Bucket is glitchy and gets stuck easily
Control arm likes to get stuck under dirt causing amazing flips through the air.
Control arm does not quite reach far enough causing you to accidentally dig underneath yourself.
Getting stuck in holes is frequent.
Digging underground can be scary.
Tunnel digging needs to be assisted. Visually:
Pros:
Definitely looks like an excavator
Cons:
Not a tracked vehicle, has tires instead.
HUGE!! HUUUUUGGGGGEEEE!!!!! So with that said, I can neither confirm or deny if I like the excavator. It chews through everything though, (except trees, will chew leaves though). I am interested in what this thing sounds like. Sound is currently not working on this build.
I am surprised that the devs didn't decide to go with a tracked vehicle. Tires have been a problem for us, powered carts, carts etc. Tracks would allow us to move more evenly across terrain and not get stuck in the many holes this thing can chew out of the earth. Another concern of mine is the general practicality of the excavator, sure it's cool to use for mountain clearing or general construction purposes, however it isn't that practical for digging where as an industrial auger or mining truck would be.
I was thinking it would be cool to attach a bulldozer blade to the excavator to push dirt rather than to pick it up. I foresee problems with people getting these things stuck underground and perhaps flying through the air. I would like to take from the excavator the tires and place the 4 tires on the powered cart, the three wheeler is very hard to drive at first until you can get used to its semi-truck wide turns. I will say this, since this thing miraculously works under water it's great for island building. I have not yet tried to dump items into the stockpile with the excavator. I am interested to see if that's possible. I am going to try dumping buckets into the stockpile first then try to dump it into powered carts and so forth. We played mostly with the mechanics and not the overall day to day use with it. You guys tell me what you think.. have you tried it yet?"

I have a fix. 0.5.5.4 Updated Information! | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2344/camas-shortage-i-have-a-fix-0-5-5-4-updated-information,4026,14,1,MagicBackPack,"Hey folks so I was playing on MoonMaster server (fun server, currently in the process of setting up free stuff for new players for those interested) and after a few days I noticed our camas plants were in short supply (~50 world wide!) so the fix I found for it was to get into farming.  after a bit of experimentation I found the best thing to do was find camas in it's natural habitat, then build crop plots and plant camas bulbs in said plot.  the happy accident I found was that you can pretty much grow every plant (except desert and tundra plants) in the same biome.  not quite as efficiently as elsewhere but making yourself a super farm with everything in one place is pretty efficient.  one downside is camas bulbs are 0.1 kg a piece so the weight adds up, so plan accordingly as you'll probably be out in the plains away from trees and making roads is time consuming.  Grassland Seed yield skill is a must to be able to get more camas per plant.  so far the biome supports wheat, corn, beets, beans, huckleberries, camas, and even fiddleheads.  corn takes ~10 hours to grow in the biome and its yield varies, but this should help some folks to keep their plants from going extinct.  anyone who wants to join the server please don't harvest wild camas plants, I'll give you free ones as the farm produces more than enough for everyones needs.  I'll be doing some experimentation with fertilizer next and I'll update once I do. The Update: Letting your fields go Fallow does indeed work, yesterday I noticed that I had a few plots at 0.0 on nitrogen and phosphate after having a plant that wouldn't grow (wheat for those interested) that I proceeded to pull (when it's neighbors were perfectly fine on the next tilled plot over) after laying fallow for ~20 hours the soil restored itself to it's original nitrogen and phosphate levels (in keeping with similar readings with the other plots around) how long it takes to recover naturally is somewhere between 2 and 20 hours as i had checked it before logging off.  the plants do suck nutrients and they do have to be replenished.  what each plant requires is a mystery to me as of yet, but this means crop rotation/fertilization is an important thing to keep in mind. Also if you have recently excavated and built up a farming ""plateau (spelling?)"" the soil will most likely be devoid of nutrients as I have recently discovered so if you terraform/expand your farm plan accordingly so as not to waste seeds.  I did a major overhaul of my fields on sunday (05/14/2017) and have plots that are still struggling to recover as of Wednesday (05/17/2017) the plots that are struggling appear to be ones that I had ""built up"" as opposed to ""dug out"" the dug out plots seem to be doing fine from what I can see and the growth patterns support this idea."

That is a very low yield rate but I am using this as an example Ideally I want to try to plant in an area where the Overall growth rate and overall yield rate are both over 60%..... I have tried keeping these plants growing here with fertilizer but honestly it takes like 12 hours to grow and usually I get a very reduced yield...  if they were above 60% I could expect the grow time to be 4 hours or less and the projected max yield to be double.  The only reason I was able to pass the projected max yield was through the use of fertilizers. I will be honest with you if this plant wasn't more just for fun I would never keep attempting to grow a plant where the growth and yield rates where below 60%.  I would find a better area. I know farming can be difficult and you cant  grow all the plants in the same area, it requires you to be spread out over multiple biomes to truly get a good return. I am hoping in the future they allow something like greenhouses where you can customize the environment to the plants so that we don't have to go half way around the world to grow camas and beans since they obviously wont grow anywhere near each other with any real success.

While I do not believe that there is a EULA setup yet for ECO I am sure there will be one by time it goes to Beta.  Violating a EULA or even without one in many cases in which you use a glitch to your own gain has been and usually is an offense that many games will ban your entire account for.  I am not saying that is the case here but it is always better to error on the side of caution that to tell someone to use a glitch.   The glitch is that no object should be able to be picked up while there is something in the inventory.  This is a reported bug that is being worked, and as such should not be recommended for players to use. Also if you do this with a store it will break the economy viewer and crash the client when someone attempts to use the economy viewer.

This debate stems from a number of factors but typically involves the argument that the issues are part of the game and require no changes or external programs to take advantage of them.[2] On github they do have this listed as a bug to be fixed with high priority.  please refer to https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoIssues/issues/1333 Please understand that this posting is not a personal attack but meant to be informative because obviously I have had education and I do know how to research and find information and i do understand the definition of an exploit as it pertains to video games.  I did not post my original post as an attack of any kind but to inform people it is a bug it is on the list to be fixed and that if ECO Devs or Server Admins do not care if you use this bug which I can fully understand in an Alpha, some may do something about it and they have every right to.  I believe encouraging the use of a bug to ones advantage is not playing the game as the designers have intended and personally would not use that to my advantage.  How you play and what you do is completely up to you and I will not judge you for it, but at the same time i would never personally encourage someone to use a known bug to gain advantage in a game."

The lasers take a long time to charge, and I'm honestly not 100% sure how they function either, but that should at least get you going.

general,Surviving the impact of the meteor | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2254/surviving-the-impact-of-the-meteor,3525,4,4,rentechd,There is no player death so I assume you don't die when the meteor hits but I have never seen a world after the meteor hits - but I understand there is pretty much nothing left so even if you did dig deep enough to survive the impact I am not sure you could survive after it - like have food and other stuff you need once your supplies run out. If you don't want to deal with a meteor at all or want to build for a long time before the meteor comes you can set your server to have no meteor or set it not to show up for any number of real days you want to play.  I know of many servers that have the meteor set for 180 day (6 month real life game play).  So you do have options

Our president's pal putted up a shop which asks certain goods and if you sell it in that shop you'll get coins because tbh atm you need to craft them yourself in the mint which isn't ideal at all. Example; sell 1 timber, get 5 coins, etc. As feedback for future updates perhaps labor work by the government could earn you coins (build roads, build a house, town hall, bank, shopping area -> community area's, you literally work for the government). Mostly those will bring in a currency to get things started, so i'd love to have more options to spread the currency. Ever borrowing some kind of loan from the 'bank/mint' to get you a quick head-start with coins. Making them yourself and specing into gold efficiency is mandatory for now if you want to make loads of credits, if nothing else has been setup like the shop for example. Other then that nobody would want a different currency if everybody uses the same and if the value/good is decent enough. It's much more handy compared to trading good v good since you only need currency. Last but not least you need to have a certain job, not all over the place with all the skills and everyone can create everything. Nobody bothers to buy things if you can create everything, which is still an issue imo. The more specialisation, the more others will/can buy because of demand. Same for the buildings; others can use your buildings with a certain tax value. If everybody has everything they won't use your building; if everybody is specialised they will need other builds, therefore need a currency to use them (in case it has a tax rating on it). It's a snowball effect really -> you get coins, use it on someone else's machine, they get coins, buy this product / use that building,... it goes on and on.  :)"

From basic experiments with corn seeds, a soil sampler and and a bit of land I gathered that: -> There is a ""soil state"" grid with 4x4 cells (so not aligned to the claim grid).
-> Farming variables (nutrients, temperature, rain, etc) are uniform across those 4x4 cells I think that: ~> The ""Land can support"" value for a particular plant is the number of plant you can farm renewably on this 4x4 cell without depleting the nutrients and hence use fertilizers. So a ""land can suppport"" of 16 (4x4) or more is a perfect value. (I hope this is not viewed as spoilers and that I'm not misinforming)"

I ask because when I first started playing, I built my town way up in the mountains. This was great until all the metals and sand I needed were at the bottom. I thought I'd use the cart to lug all that around, but to make a road going down with the ramps, I'd have to make a monumental bridge that goes down, as the ramps are 4 blocks long. Is there any way to shrink the ramps down to one or two blocks so I don't have to deforest the place and spend weeks building this mega ramp?"
general,Road Ramps? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2132/road-ramps,760,2,2,MGrand3,"@sshinofield There is currently no way to do this, sadly. Perhaps a mod could be made (I might have to look into that)? One thing you can do is sort of zig-zag your way up with a ramp going to the right, a road curving around and then a ramp going to the left etc. Will be a bit wider than your original plan, and more time consuming to get up, but should save the space I guess. The one issue I can think of with making ramps shorter is that the incline might be too big so the cart starts rolling down on its own, and you might not even be able to get up quickly, if at all."

I've been burned by alpha games before (cubeworld) and need to know if this can be played solo or if it's more a social game. Not that I mind either its just I tend to play odd hours.
general,Is it worth it? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1946/is-it-worth-it,2011,8,2,Master Who,My two cents: In 5.4 you can solo in this game. Make a server on your computer and join it and have fun(?) with that. You could also join other servers and have fun that way. In 5.5+ The game is a little too hard to do by yourself. What use to take a few hours to get your skills up now could take all day by yourself. Both: There are a lot of servers with different admins with different play styles. There is also a lot of players from around the world that play at 'odd hours' as well. Hope that helps. --MW--

if you like games that will required teamwork with other players, this is the game for you.
if you like play solo, this will be a hardcore game for you. the reason is because your skill will increase everyday but at certain times, learning new skills will require a lot of skill points. also you will waste a lot of times because some works need to be focused more.
teamwork in this game gonna be the main key to success and also careful planning. divide the job with other players will help tech and community advance faster and will have higher chance to reach your targeted goal faster hope you get what i try to say.

maybe you just don't the wiki enough. all i can say is if you think this game have bright future, you like this game and you wanna support the dev team, buy it.

I am playing on a server where we work coop and also with many features the other person doesn't have to be on at the same time to play coop style, they have stores where you can trade your good for theirs even if they are not online.  That being said I also have my own local server running, sometimes I just enjoy playing it and not worrying about other people, while it will take a bit longer to progress it is still quite fun. Also for an Alpha this game is very polished, not perfect but no big game ending bugs that I have found at all.  I would and have suggested this game to many of my friends, even bought it for some of them, and they all enjoy it. Also pay no attention to Brie101 if you look at their postings they are just trolling the entire forum."

We are doing in fact fine .. Though i must admit that time estimates for the beta are off. Though this is nothing unormal, it is hard to impossible to predict release times early in development. And i am sorry about that . every beta backer should have access now to the alpha though and we are sorry to use more time than expected. Originally we planed to release the beta apr 2016 but did not even make that date close to that. but the alpha got released in 2015 as promised ;) We got allot of good feedback we have been working on and new ideas we have been implementing. Something that has increased the development time of eco. Optimizing is still a thing that needs to be done but it is already allot better then earlier version like alpha 1-3 . But there is still allot of optimizing work left =) So . Eco is not dead and we dont have any problems =) but it is taking a bit longer than expected but this is normally for any early access game and to be expected ;)"

We have allot more and often updates. But there is no point makinga 5000 word news update on some minor fixes to backers. Its better to gather several updates and inform backers about that. While our community can keep track here. You cant also expect that a small dev team of around 6 people can make large changes to the core game ( that require to go trough all code to make the game working again because small changes in core gameplay can break the whole game) every 2-3 weeks. This takes unfortunately 1-2 month actually. Making a game is actually a hard thing. and its not easy at all. It takes also quite some time. Just look at stardew valley made by 1 person. Its allot simpler than eco since its a 2d game without a large eco system to simulate and balance . It still took that one person 4 years to make that game. Its a great game but it takes time, something you cant do over night. We are aware of performance issues and optimization and we work on them . But putting to much energy into optimization right now that we would have to re optimize on every large update. Something that would greatly increase the development time. That's why optimization is always done closer to the end of the development cycle in a game."

We're all fans of Minecraft, so a similar game appealed, especially since it has more features (affecting the world having consequences and causing animals to be extinct vs a cow just spawning because it's light enough).

I really love this concept, espacially that the world you are playing will be different, not just because of the random-gen world, but also because of the people you play with and their decisions. From looking at it, I hope there will be more of a need for continous material usage beside fuel (such things as repairing or building new tools because old one broke). If I should get into the game, I would probably play on a public server and I would want to experience the way people are handling their environment. I though about going private, but on a private server, you are way too much in touch with your fellow players, which leads to ""perfectly planned"" scenarions. Although I want to achieve that on the public server, you are also playing with strangers which each have their own opinion and preferences."

If you're talking about the wild populations, there's a bug right now that's preventing animals from respawning. It will be fixed in a future staging version. Animals will only breed when the local plant population (or prey, in the case of wolves and foxes) can support additional animals. This includes wild and planted crops. Animals cannot magically appear where a population doesn't already exist (such that if you clear a forest of elks, no more will appear since they're all dead). Destroying the food that the animals eat will cause them to die due to starvation."

The issue in the current build is the animals not retaining decimal populations correctly, so when the population in an area is changed by say 0.01, it does nothing. Setting the Species Change Rate increases the rate at which the animals will repopulate when killed, so 1 ensures that they're always spawning in every tick. The amount will be determined based on the number of animals an area can support. The amount that is supported is determined by the calorie intake of the animals."

I realy lik it, but actually the efficiency is just way to low. You can get yourself fed and that was it. I play on a bigger server with around 100 people, but nearly everyone takes farming/cooking cause the player who want to specialise on farming/cooking can´t get everyone fed. Not even close. And as in the agriculture threat another big problem is that most servers are way to wet so camas and wheet grows very very slow, without the possibility to dry soil that makes the problem even worse.
So i realy like the idea of specialising to be realy good in something, but well, if we do, we should be realy good at it."

Now, if you want to progress technology at the cost of higher materials, you can. As for efficiency scaling being low, I have to disagree with that for at least at the top end. Early ranks of efficiency are seeing a re-balance to get the values more linear, but they'll still cap out at 80% which is a very, very significant bonus. The state of very early game food (survival's campfire cooking skill) is a bit too unwieldy given the time and material costs of the recipes, so that will likely get a significant change. But after farming and better efficiency skills, the higher costs and timers of the food should become more than manageable."

I don't think the cost of materials is the problem I think it's the amount they are having to eat just to make something simple.  People are spending more time trying to find food and cooking food than they are in their own specialization and that is what is making it not fun.  Lower the amount of calories used at first to gather materials but still have the efficiencies get you to the same end point as it currently does. Also i think this is a bad way of trying to make people specialize and become cooperative.  The best bet would be to lock them into a specialization until maybe they spend 150 points in them, then they can start working on another.  The only problem with this is then you can't lock the requirements of one specialization behind another. You could create a specialization tree to where they chose their starting profession, say it looks something like this Specializations Carpenter Masonry Agriculture Cooking Butcher Keep them locked to only this profession until they spend 150 skill points in that profession
Once they unlock their second one they must spend 150 in it to unlock a third profession, but they can still spend points in their first profession if they chose as well but any points spent in their first profession will not count towards the 150 needed in the second to unlock the third. With this you could also have what I guess you can call life skills such as gathering, basic campfire cooking (not the things from the cooking skill, they would require the cooking profession and improved campfire)....these would be skills anyone can put points into, in fact I would probably require 10 points be spent in these before unlocking a profession. The truth of the matter is people specialize in jobs IRL and the carpenters depend on the metal workers to make the tools they use, everyone depends on the cooks and the cooks depend on the farmers.  If you really want to encourage coop play style that's about the only way to do it, otherwise people will always do what they want and not what is in the best interest of the server.... we are human we are flawed, we need guidelines and rules or we will do what suits us every time. This also excites me for future possibilities in professions and careers, there could be merchants, bankers, politicians.... the game touches on these some but not in great detail.... but politicians could create laws and be in charge of enforcing those laws and setting punishments  ( ie.... you may only kill one wolf per day...very famous law on many servers.... well if you break it the politician could give punishment of no skill point gains for 12 hours, or temporary ban for 1 hour, all dependant upon if it's a first offense of multiple.  The politicians would have to research criminal law in order to build a jail, maybe one punishment could be that your character has to spend time in the jail... since time in game changes quicker than RL time i would say use in game time, maybe 1 day in jail.... but that would be one day while logged in, if you log out it continues where you left off when you logged out). But locking people to a profession until a certain number of skill points are spent in that profession is about the only way you will accomplish this.  150 skill points is not that hard if you are working on efficiencies and such but it would take them about 2 to 3 RL days to get there maybe make it more but it's something worth playing around with and would encourage cooperation on a server, because let's face it a carpenter isn't making a saw mill without a metal worker helping them..... but currently its just eat some decent food log back in every day to eat log out, and when you get enough skill points take smithing..... that's what is happening now, locking professions would make them talk to the metal workers, find out what they need and trade and barter for the items you need..... as long as all i have to do is logout and wait, why play during that time i'm building skills and why depend on others."

I think they could do a mix bettween two systems and it probably make every one happy then you could just yet server admins control how the skill points are handed out. so people who just want to play and earn skills by doing things and not have to wait can and people who just want to play waiting game can do that. alot of games do this - ark - empryion galactic surival, and new conan game they both use both systems one in eco and one where u earn by doing and then its up to server owners to decide how they want game to be played and people can pick what ever system they want. they could also allow server owners ability to control speed at which it is handed out and if they can be handed out offline or not.

While some things probably do deserve a little tweak here and there (small sign costs twice as many boards as a full sign yet its smaller lol) it is pretty balanced.  I say this after I complained as well to @Lhamabomb for the high costs and energy usage only to take some of his advice and use the efficiencies more.... what a difference they make. So to kind of sum up my take on this build.... it's not just about managing your eco system but about managing your efficiencies, materials and time as well.  the key is efficiency, once you get those up the cost of materials and the energy used to get them is pretty good, you can't just rush right through the profession you need to take your time and do it right or you're going to be paying a high price for everything and then it may not seem fun. So to all the people saying its not fun anymore, have you maxed out your efficiencies before pushing forward or are you just wanting instant gratification?  It's kind of like building a new house, I am sure your contractor can have something for you to live in, in less than a week, but would it be as nice as if you gave them 6 months to do it right."
general,A waiting game. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2047/a-waiting-game,3454,13,9,Th3N3rd,"We change stuff to fit a style we prefer, for example, on my previous server i changed that most food recipies cost 1.5x as much as what they cost in the base game since it was so easy with my efficenices to just spam food from nothingness and felt it needed to be harder.  Likewise on 5.5 i feel certain things, like log roofs taking 2min to craft a peice, which for even a moderate house being lets say 10x10 needs 100 of those taking what will be 2hrs 20min.  Yes i can reduce this to i think it was 1min 24sec with i believe a lvl2 effecient in the skill and that shoots it down allot, but still sometime.  I simply felt this was something that needed tweaking.  Also I've changed carts so that wood carts can take all slots full of drit/logs, normally only taking 5 slots of 10 (50 total) before hiting the weight limit.  Sure things are balanced as far as somethings go and i do agree that the efficencies matter a hell of allot more now.  But this choice to speed things up a little or even make things harder is simply something we chose to do.  And honeslty this is a far cry from Plan B of typing ""/giveskillpoints Th3N3rd,1000000"" into the console and unlocking everything which i believe is more instant gratification than reducing the base of those logs roof from 2min to 1min 30sec just to help reduce things a little."
general,A waiting game. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2047/a-waiting-game,3454,13,10,toxxikz,"@Th3N3rd I can understand that point of view and i can understand wanting things to happen quicker. From my perspective the roof pieces taking 2 hours 20 mins can be reduced down to 28 minutes with maxed efficiencies,  which IMO is a way not only of making you work for what you want but about time and resource management.  like I said in my earlier post it's not just about a better eco system but it's about better management of your skills and your time and your materials.  But that is my opinion and I can see your side of it as well, it's a game not a career you want it to be a little more forgiving. As for the cart, they are so easy to make and still way better than carrying things with a shovel,I believe they put the limit on them to make you want to strive for the better transportation.  At the same time the better transportation takes a lot longer to get where you need to be in order to make it.  It is still in alpha and I know there will still be major changes coming down the line.  I hope they add another class of cart that can maybe hold a bit more, or maybe let you make improvements to the cart by making stone wheels that can hold more weight."
general,A waiting game. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2047/a-waiting-game,3454,13,11,Th3N3rd,"as of current my experience with carts is that wood carts are best for almost everything except long hauls, the steering and size of the powered makes it practically need 6 block wide roads for best results (turning corners and allowing say a 2nd powered cart to be traveling in the other direction)  For a long haul that can be for the most part straight (for example in building the mine/foundry far away from main area like i suggested above) I'd build the 6 wide road for that so that powered carts can be used well, but having 6 wide roads in lets say inner city construction on the servers i played on doesn't look too good nor is what most of us built to.  So i edited the wood cards to have more capacity so that inside the city they can be more useful or inside a mine.  while in dramatically increased the weight on powered carts and increased their speed on asphalt and stone roads but reduced it down on dirt roads and super reduced it on non roads, to make them useful for long hauls but not so much anywhere else. but i think discussion of these mechanics can be left to perhaps another thread, no need to hijack this one xD"

It's made great progress and i'm sure anyone that's played a prior version knows that. I keep telling the people i play with, if it's a balance issue like the pollution spread or what not, stuff like that is wonky because alpha isn't the time for fine tuning. Alpha is the time for brute force changes that can change large swaths of the game. There's no point in spending lots of energy on fine tuning a system that may or may not get scrapped because it looked better on paper than it did in code. This applies to everything, even abnormally high material requirements because there are items that aren't functional yet (all the speed and cost modules like chairs and shelves) And side Note: I'll be spending some more time working on agriculture today, so maybe might keep an eye on that other post, i've already got some new theories :D Might even take pictures :D"

Is there a shift click or something that moves it if younhave 2 windows opened. I still find you have to drag and drop. Splitting doesn't work still either.

What kind of threats, other than ecological ones, do you face as you try to survive?
Do you have to specialize your skills or will you accumulate enough to just do everything?
I think that's it for now.. Thanks!"
general,Curious before buying... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1949/curious-before-buying,2013,7,2,Balmarog,"Oh, one more thing. All the maps I have seen look very small. How many people can survive and populate these lands?"
general,Curious before buying... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1949/curious-before-buying,2013,7,3,SD 7,"@Balmarog As far as I know about the maps: you can change the size of the worlds. So if you know how many people will play on your world, you can easily adjust it to have enough space. I'm not sure how it affects the eco system though."
general,Curious before buying... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1949/curious-before-buying,2013,7,4,Zaskersky,"Well i shall try to answer your question keep in mind the game is in alpha 0.5.4 so many things hope fully still change. In 0.5.4. there are no threats, unless you go to the extreme and create threats yourself, the basic map size is 100*100, and we have been playing on it with +- 5-15 people, and not even making a tiny dent in the plant population as it grows back so fast, same goes for tree's only thing that is easy to kill is animals if you go kill more then you need on purpose. If you play with default game settings, you have to specialize and team work. its also possible to do it solo but just takes a lot lot longer.
At current game version we go from nothing to all content unlocked with +- 4-6 people in about 13-20 days if you play well as a team.
You can also create a custom server with increased xp multiplier so you can solo the content at a faster rate. The game shows great potential, in the ways of becoming a survival game in the future. But in its current state its in development and it offers not much of a challenge or endgame, no threat of starvation, pollution, or problems with using to much resources. All the things are already partial in the game, but not all are 100% functional yet or are not fine tuned yet to a way the games becomes hard.
So if you like to become part of its development and have the time to see how the game rolls out, this is a good moment but if you expect a game that's is challenging, then its not the right moment. Greetings Zaskersky"

general,Curious before buying... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1949/curious-before-buying,2013,7,7,rentechd,"@Brie101  Sorry you are having issues but that is a very unfair blanket statement.  AT best you should say that you can't connect.  I have been playing for a couple of the alpha versions now and have had no issues and I have been playing with a large number of people that have been having great fun with this game.  The game is very playable.  This is an alpha game and there was no secret about that when you bought it so if your bashing it because it was not 'finished' enough for you, that is unfair - you bought it knowing it was in alpha.  Your also misleading people by saying that they can't connect to servers.  I can connect to all the servers that I am either invited to so that I have permissions to get on or public servers and are running the same version as my client.  It certainly is not too early for the public to play or for it to be open to the public.  The developers are very dedicated and are around pretty much daily to deal with issues and support people are available and overly helpful.  When you get involved in a game in alpha you have to plan to be part of the solution and if you have an issue you bring it to those that can support you to resolve that issue.  There is nothing constructive about posting the way you have.   Some people just are not good candidates for playing early access or alpha games and you shuld be honest with yourself and just not get involved with a game in that phase if you can't approach it constructively.  You probably would be better off waiting for games to be finished before you buy them as that seems to be closer to your expectations."

My server only spawned with 200 wheat, so I'll deplete that super quick, even with farming working. Everything just seems super unbalanced with the update."
general,Food situation unbalanced? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2017/food-situation-unbalanced,1431,6,2,Object,"It'll take a few days to figure out if it's actually imbalanced or not, at the moment I think everyone is just experiencing a knee-jerk reaction to being forced to adapt to the new system.  At the moment we're getting by fairly well on the Greenleaf server but I'd be lying if I didn't say it was more challenging. I personally think the new tweaks are forcing groups to work together much more closely and focus on getting efficiency skills, once you gain those skills the recipes aren't as bad.  You can get to 55% with efficiency skills within a few days without an issue if you specialize in a few skills instead of diversifying. The last update I played was 5.3 and I was able to solo build most stuff while relying on only one friend for the rest of the stuff I needed.  Now I find it requires groups of 4+ to see any kind of progress. To quote Craig, he said
I've been pretty restrained in jacking up the prices of constructions (and most of them haven't changed much since 4.0) but that's going to significantly change going forward. There is going to be a huge emphasis placed on efficiency and speed skills to encourage specialization through that rather than simply the ability to perform a task. Not only should this help specialization, but it should give players who are on a lot a bigger reason to gather resources and create means of doing so."
general,Food situation unbalanced? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2017/food-situation-unbalanced,1431,6,3,MGrand3,"@Object I think the reason for the abundance of food in 5.4 was the lack of farming. In 5.5 you kinda need to start farming as soon as possible, at least if you have a lot of people playing. Craig mentioned adding modifiers for the plants and skills so we can quickly adapt the settings to the amount of people playing. A modifier to change the skill rate (really just makes time go faster) will be in 5.5.2, hopefully the modifiers for plants will be added at some point too."

Maybe they will add attacks from animals or such but the threat here is from the ecology and the meteor not from wars with other players.  I think the premise of this game would be totally lost if ""combat"" was added. I am very happy to find a game that has a central focus that is not killing each other and griefing the neighbors.  There are plenty of games out there where that is the premise, its nice to have something to worry about on a much grander scale.  Where you are motivated to build a community or communities and work towards something rather then just getting a jump on everyone else so you can kill them and take their stuff."
general,Any NEW co-op server? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1890/any-new-co-op-server,1854,8,7,MetroDetroitGaming,Did you just compare this to Rust? Well in a survival situation of any sort you are ALWAYS going to deal with other people being part of the survival element. Sounds like you just are not good at PVP type games and prefer PVE. Comparing this to Rust tho is like comparing a banana with a baseball bat.

You cannot connect to games, there are private games listed under public, the game constantly crashes and disconnects or won't refresh the server list. I understand this is in alpha development but if you want people to play your game for you and test it out, then make that a feature that works FIRST. Hosting a local server or a private one for you and friends should NOT be this complicated. The connection system actually seems to have gotten worse since Alpha 5 was released. At least during alpha 4 I could connect or be rejected by a server without the game crashing. Get the skin-and-bones basics prepared first, or close the game to the public until they're ready."

The refresh option, if used, causes the game to crash or not load any servers and you are stuck on a blank screen and have to close and reopen the game. Its a messy jumble that just shouldn't be out yet at all."

general,Why is this game even public yet? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1954/why-is-this-game-even-public-yet,2357,10,8,Faalin,"I've ran into a few of his issues, but nothing to rant about. Yes to click on a server to see that its white listed sucks, the game basically crashes as it wont allow you to pick another server, but it takes all of a minute to end task the game and re-login.   Another thing to look at is if the server has been online for 2 days and only 4 people are playing its ether a white list server or private, just move along. The server refresh button works just fine for me, although any server that is offline takes a little longer to populate the server list which would be expected. Yeah it would be nice to have drop down menu to select what servers were shown on the list, between regional and white list or private servers. All in all for being an alpha game its not doing that bad, yes some features are not working and other things have bugs but thats why you are ALPHA testing it.  to report things that are wrong and should be fixed.   The game isnt meant to be played its meant to be stressed and find faults within the game."
general,Why is this game even public yet? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1954/why-is-this-game-even-public-yet,2357,10,9,rentechd,"There is a rationale reason that there are Public Servers that are whitelisted.  Many people have groups of people that play that apply through forums or discord groups and they want them to be able to find the server by name so they make it public while also only whitelisting those that have applied, and been approved.  This is not something bad or wrong with the game, this is how many servers work in many server browser lists.  Public servers can be whitelisted - public does not mean it has to be open to everyone. It sounds like you may need to verify or refresh your game files because over the multiple 100's of times I have been in and out of servers without a problem with the refresh screen.  Although simple hitting escape and disconnecting and reloading the game is so fast it is something to take in stride. I have never had the refresh option crash the game browser unless I mashed it like 50 times very, very fast - but almost anything would crash if you do that to it. I am sure, as the alpha progresses, just like other games that have server browser lists, the browser list will evolve but this is an alpha and it won't be perfect.  Its hardly a ""messy jumble"" and its very usable and you can find the server you are looking for.  Many alpha games don't even have an in-game server browser to start with so I guess they should not have been out either? As for your statement ""Hosting a local server or a private one for you and friends should NOT be this complicated"" does not make too much sense.  Its not difficult at all to run a local server and its even easier to make it private if you want.  Its not complicated at all and many people do it.  If its too complicated for you, you can go to a hosting service and they can set one up for you.  But simply because a person chooses to not open a server up - whether its local or dedicated or whatever - to the whole world does not mean it can't be in the browser list.  I think you are confused about that.  You are always going to find servers ina  browser list that won't let you in.  Its how things work. This game is out as an alpha and they are very clear that its an alpha and that everything won't be perfect.  The idea of making an alpha available to people is so that we can help grow the game and find the problems.  If your not ready for that, or want a finished product then you should not be buying into a game while its in its alpha phase.  This is on you as to whether you can deal with an alpha game not on the developer to close the game to its players because you can't. I see this all the time with games on Steam that are sold with big banners on them telling people its an early access game, in alpha, and there will be bugs and lost game data, and crashes etc , etc.  They buy the game cause they ""have to be the first"" and they whine over and over about the little stuff not being perfect and demanding that game act like a finished production.  If things like this bother you, then your not the type of gamer that can handle games in the alpha and beta phase and you should not be buying a game until it is in its final release.  Next time you see a game, check to see if its a final release and if its not then wait to buy it.   There is a good reason for opening games in alpha and beta phases to the public to invest in and play - for those of use that want to be part of a game's evolution and can enjoy a game even if we have to deal with issues - heck many people like finding issues to report - but you will notice that their reports are constructive and that's a big difference.   You can give constructive criticism about what you find with the browser and offer suggestions on what you think would be better without demanding they stop selling the game and close it down."

The only problem is if we buy this game now, will we receive a steam key when it's released on steam, or how does it work?

Other then that; you can download the client via the webpage and start playing straight away once you've unpacked the ZIP file. You can join various servers (but may not be super populated - it's only an alpha, we're still testing features), this functions properly already (make sure to favorite the ones you are playing on, easier to join the server again later on). Also; make sure you have the right version. Certain servers play on alpha 5.3, others on 5.4, some on 5.5,... downgrading or upgrading might be needed sometimes. You'll notice in the server list if you have a different version. :) Hope that answers your questions!"

Put walls all around your roof. Over a short time, you will find elks and what not going on your roof and getting stuck. Leave them, and then after a day or so there will be a crap ton up there.

I have no noticed much of issues, I seen more issues in 5.4 honestly I quit playing 5.4 before 5.5 came out and 5.5 is a pleasure to play compared to 5.4 crap. both have there issues but issues are bit less in 5.5 at least what I noticed I could not handle one more disappearing cart or losing one more cart due to animal kicking it across map or disappearing thro the ground or bugging out on a road. yet alone in 5.4 farming is completely broken and so is water stuff. personally if it was not for 5.5 I would not be playing game right now any more, I still be playing empryion or stellerias. if I would stuck with 5.4 I would been pulling my hair out of my head by now and been bald few months ago. 5.5 requires adaption though skill are completely moved around and changed point values are diff and game play in general has changed compared to 5.4 or other verison also everything has slowed down as of the game pace so you spend a lot more time at lower levels of stage in survival tree branch compared to how fast you could unlock stuff in research before 5.5 I actually think this is right direction to go, I just wish they take away the earning over time skill point thing because its even more of a  hurry up and wait off line game then it was in 5.4 or other verison, they really should move to a reward skill points for doing things style game play mechanic then a sit offline reward you with skills. because honesty 5.5 is way slower of game play now then 5.4 was or is I have one full 24 hours of time in 5.5 and I have unlocked two research books so far, and I still don't have hammer. and out of that 24 hours I think I actually only played played about 5 or 6 hours I'm going be starting 2nd 24 hour period and I really have nothing to do in game till I figure out how to get hammer. to unlock more research stuff. that being said in the 24 hours my server been up and running, I have not had one crash client or server side other then my 2008 server doing auto update on me. as far as I can see right now hammer is only build able and it requires wood and rock but you cant create wood till you unlock research for carpentry and you cant do that research unless you have hammer so I need go and ask what is up with that. I think what they should do to help this is do like other games do reward you for actions u do building crafting but also reward you for time in game. then let the server admins control these two features and amount of skill handed out for these two options skill over time and skill by action. anyways 5.5 is where there headed and it makes changes to game and game play style and every one should be concentrating on what they like or do not like because its next version I honestly think people should be playing that instead of focusing there time on playing a absolute version of the game. that way things can get improved along faster over all."

After about 30 min I let him out, where he proceeded to another house and stole his deed and started to claim his land.  Luckily it was a newb and didn't have much or understand what was going on. After about 5 min the guy gave everything back but would run from house to house and log off and back on to enter their house.  He finally ran into a house where two people where working and the trapped him and wouldn't let him out.  After about 20 min of begging to let him out and saying he wouldn't do it again he finally logged out and we haven't seen him back for a few hours."

general,[Question] Will physics be implemented? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1749/question-will-physics-be-implemented,1431,4,1,Zandesh,"Hi there,
So i'm still beating around the bushes (12 hours played) as i'm new to ECO Global, and still trying to find a server that suits my needs and wants. However, I was wondering whether physics where to be implemented in a larger scale e.g when building and you remove the pillars/parts of the foundation and then the building can be become unstable and eventually break down? Honestly, it would add more of a challenge to the game that you have to also take maintain and take care of your town, not having floating walls, if you were hit by natural disasters etc, so you actually have to face some potential dangers - I know this is not minecraft, however i'd like that there's external threats that require people to be active on servers, because it is my impression that people hoard skills, resources, after a short while then they quit."

It does not add onto your current copies. does this mean if i buy my first game.. decided hey my wife will like this. than purchase another copy i pay 70dollars ? for the second copy? or does it mean that nomatter how long it takes me if i buy a second copy it will only cost me 30 for a total of 70? anyone with any sort of enlightenment to this would be great thankyou!

Okay, maybe not a wooden chest, but if we're trying to protect the environment we don't just dump it raw into a hole in the ground. Maybe improper storage containers should leak. If I have a hundred tailings packed in a chest I think it should pollute the surrounding area much more, and at a faster rate, than the two tailings which would take up the same space if left in the open. Trying to cut corners by concentrating it that way could actually be worse than leaving it exposed in a sprawling heap, but if you put in the effort to store it in something more difficult to manufacture, like a steel barrel perhaps, you'd be rewarded for good stewardship and be able to take advantage of that convenience."

Also you can put it in the ground without any real problems (this is giving you're not putting a ton of it in the ground).

But what you burn to melt down the stuff being burnt doesn't touch the actually stuff being melted. What is being melted down is in a thing. There is some back in the stone age that doesn't use a cup, but you lose more metal that way.
(Note burning large amounts of coal is bad for the air, but not ground. But in this game it looks at the device, and not the material being burnt.) The cleaning the tail. The answer to that is no. I can't find it, but dirty jobs did a show a few years back where they clean the dirt with a machine. It basically heats up the dirt to super high temps, it then runs it down a barrel washing it. Most of the stuff burns off, so you can just filter the water and reuse it in the process. What comes out is pure dirt (carbon, and whatever else is in dirt).
This is used if their is toxic spills or something in an area."

Obviously however, the furnaces and ovens are wood/fuel burning devices.  You could not just plug in an electric cable and expect it to work (think about a normal fireplace), however if you upgraded your furnace/oven to an electrical version, then it would work.  I do not believe these have an electrical version at the moment though."

general,Utilities beyond Roads | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1671/utilities-beyond-roads,3021,10,7,Rezoken,"@Gates it is not so much a roles feature.  But when you own a crafting table there is a new tab which allows you to set up what items you are Buying and which items you are Selling. In addition to that, you can also offer which items you can currently make if people provide you the materials, and also what cost you will charge them to make.  For example, if someone wants you to butcher a Bison because you have the highest butcher skill in the server, you can say in the butcher table, I make 1 butchered bison for the cost of 1 bison carcass (for the materials) and 1 Elk Carcass to offset your costs (time etc). This will then allow you to set the prices, also when someone has been voted in as mayor they can set up a global currency (coins/notes etc) which you can then charge for your services as well, which you can then use to go down the road and buy your Saw Mill from the carpenter or something."
general,Utilities beyond Roads | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1671/utilities-beyond-roads,3021,10,8,Gates,That sounds so darn epic but it's reminding me a little of something I want to see down the road.  I found it a bit unfair that people who are gathering raw materials have to pay a premium in calories burned while anyone specializing in production via crafting benches do not.  Sometime I want to see calories burned for using production benches as well.  Either a flat cost for every minute of production or cost over time based on how many tables are running.
general,Utilities beyond Roads | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1671/utilities-beyond-roads,3021,10,9,Rezoken,"@Gates I think you have made a good point on that.  But for example, it will be a buyers market.  Say I need to make a Research Table, and I am a Miner and Woodcutter, sure I just spent a bunch of calories in that to obtain the required materials so that the producer can make it without any calories, he is still not going to get a large amount of materials from the transaction, or enough currency to purchase a lot of what he needs, so in turn he will also do stuff. Now while he was focusing on carpentry, you used your skills to get smelting working, now he needs to mine the iron to make you make the ingots (at no calorie cost) etc. But you do raise a good point, that maybe there needs to be an additional cost to using crafting tables apart from just resources and time?"

The part that worries me though is that to maintain a high level skill generation you need to eat high quality food which is harder to get so that leads to concerns where the laborer will struggle to afford high end food to stay competitive while the crafter only need eat a fraction of what the laborer needs so it's easier for them to maintain a high skill point gain. It also makes it easy to create bots in the final game.  You hardly feed them and ultra specialize one two or more to come on for three seconds to start a 5 hour craft order, feed them one high quality food to maintain max skill generation then log on tomorrow while everyone else struggles to maintain their skill generation."

How did you manage 200x200? Could you post your computer specs here?

The default 100x100 works but I should mention that in all cases the cpu load maxes out and the cpu temp runs up to 82C (a very worrying temp for me but returns to 36C when it is complete). My specs: i7 4790k 4.0 ghz, 32gb DDR3 ram 1600mhz, liquid AIO cpu cooler, location of game folder is on an SSD. Idle temps 35C, normal load temps 55-60C.

This means that all simulations continue. Shutting the server down however results in the simulations stopping and restarting when you bring the server back up.  You could handle this by setting a scheduled task on your server to shut down the Eco Server instance and restart at certain time. However, in regards to pausing the server when there are no users on the server for a time period of 30 minutes or something like that, currently this is not supported.  If there is no plans in the mix for the actual code base of the game to include this, this can be moddable once we are able to obtain Server Events such as Player Joined and Player Left."

There is an exponentially increasing stress on a server for every meter you add to the world.

They increased the world size to 200x200 from the default 100x100 and it was unplayable.

Before I do this however, I'd like to know exactly what this will mean besides the obvious x4 copies etc. Ever since I heard about this game I've been keeping a close eye on it. A reactive ecosystem based game is a concept I've toyed with for a number of years. I'd love to be able to contribute ideas and suggestions for this game, problem is I know nothing really about coding and my artistic talents are limited to certain programs. As someone actively studying an environmental degree and looking at making a career out of developing educational media I do have a lot of ideas and thoughts to share. I suppose my question would be if there is really much difference between submitting ideas via the general public forum or doing so via the developer forums? I'm also a bit concerned that as ECO is coming out of Alpha that there won't be much creative room left through BETA onward. I'm still probably going to upgrade just because I fully support this game and it'd be neat to have an insider perspective on its development, but any insight as to the above would be appreciated.

We use git (albeit using GitLab and GOGS rather than github) pretty extensively in my office, so I should be able to get up to speed (in theory - I'm sure I'll be eating those words if/when I get further into things).  I'm thinking it would be something like setting the fork's upstream to point to the main upstream and making sure to pull with rebase into your local fork to stay up to sync? That's similar to how we manage feature branches while someone is making merges into our master branch.   How many devs at large are working on things?"

general,Tree Regrowth | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1586/tree-regrowth,4128,3,2,Fizzgig,"So my brother and I set up on the edge of a forest and there was a coastline some distance away. We began logging to build our house, couple of tress sometimes, then five or six, then more and more until we found that we were nearing the coast line. Our house is not at the edge of the forest any longer. Then we decided to take trees from elsewhere to preserve what was left of the forest area around us. Took about 10-12 RL days I think but I finally started seeing some saplings return and it takes about 1-2 RL days for them to become a full grown tree. Now I don't know if this is part of the game or not but in a different area I noticed saplings appear faster if the stumps were removed. I saw a section regrow in about 3 days. So I immediately went home to our ""forest"" and took out all the stumps. So I hope they start to grow faster. And finally here's my biggest tip for you. My brother and I did not have logging efficiency in the beginning, and that is most of the reason our forest got clear cut so dramatically. I recommend get up to level 3 before doing any serious logging. Its amazing, just two or three trees will fill up a whole chest. After level 3 the skill cost is a lot higher so I'd stop there, but even level 3 makes a major difference."

For example.  My carbs and vitamins were higher than my protein and fat, so I figure I'll eat meat to make my skill points go up.  I eat the meat and my skill points go down!

If you have
20
12
20
20
x1.5
so it will add all of that up 20+12+20+20=72 x1.5 =108 skill points Now as far as i can tell if you have any 2 values high and any 2 values low or even 0
20
0
0
20
you get a x of 1
well an x1 is basically no bonus. 40 x1 = 40 so your goal is to get the multiplier as close to 2 as you can by balancing out the other 2 Thats the reason eating somethings can make it go lower because you change that multiplier. Hope I explained it right."

As of v0.5.4 there is no player damage or any hostile interactions. That being said the point of ECO at the moment is to prevent an asteroid that is slowly making its way towards your world. After 30 days (default) if you have not developed the sufficient technology to stop the asteroid everything will be destroyed. So stress wise I guess there is that sort of race against the clock element, but if you have a good group of people all working together I imagine it wouldn't be that hard. Unfortunately I haven't had the chance to play with a group yet but I imagine half of the experience would come from emergent gameplay with others. Hope this helps!"

All you need to do to progress fast is to get your nutritional value balanced for maximum skillpoints per day.
The first few days of gametime will be the slowest and it will increase from there once you start getting your cooking in order but during that time you are so new to the game so just exploring and picking plants and enjoying the scenery makes time fly by faster to compensate for that. In general i would think ECO would be therapeutic experience in general i would even allow children play this game without fearing they would have nightmares or such.

But more importantly MY LAIR IS NOW NON SYMMETRICAL! also aesthetically displeasing to me.  Is there anyway to create smooth stone again? or am i going to have to move the floor down a level?"

general,Farming? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1526/farming,2857,10,6,NoBlackThunder,No ETA ..Would love to be able to give out eta's but its basically impossible. core mechanics them self are still being changed and often cause allot of extra and unpredictable work that takes allot more time. It would just make you irritated if i would say next week and then we used a month because of several other thinks ;) Honestly its really hard to give any time frame.

The best thing if you are unsure is to wait for steam release. You will be at least be able to see people on steam playing eco and can have a good overview. Right now we dont have allot of numbers but its allot up and down. Most ups come always with new patches and then a down period when it takes some time to the next patch. Something that is quite normal .. But personally i feel that we have a good growing community. Each patch i can see more and more active servers . Sadly i cant give you a better answer.  Eco is still in a very early alpha stages and has allot of bugs and crashes right now since we still work actively in changing allot of core game mechanics so that causes often thinks still to break. Hope that helps

general,Thoughts so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1512/thoughts-so-far,1838,6,1,Advent_Cloud,Bought the game on February 2nd. First impressions are absolutely amazed. It has taken some getting use to concepts and learning where to drop skill points but as time has gone on I have found that for the most part people are willing to work together. It would be nice to have a voice chat option rather than just typing however it is understood that it is still early. Found it hard to start out without having a friend to start off with. Albeit the server I did join had some people who were very helpful. Devs keep up the good work. Look forward to helping with bugs and the development of the game.

general,Project Goals? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1488/project-goals,1142,2,1,LordBloodpool,"This is a open question to both the development team at StrangeLoopGames and anyone who thinks they have something to add. Now, I'm personally very impressed by what this game has to offer currently, and the additional features that have been promised, but I want to play devil's advocate and ask some questions some people might find uncomfortable. First and foremost, I notice this game is (at least in part) funded by kickstarter. This might not seem like a problem to some people, but my personal opinion is one of immediate suspicion. Call me a cynic, but too many kickstarter projects have promised much and delivered little of what was initially promised - what's to say this game won't be any different? Kickstarter-funded projects also seem to me to have an inherent problem of lacking a clear project plan - at least, they don't usually have a plan that's made immediately clear to potential backers/buyers. For example, which features are currently in the game, and which aren't? - all the material I've read on the site so far has been a little hazy in regards to what's actually in the game in it's current state. Additionally, when is the game expected to be ""complete""? I understand that the game is currently in early alpha, and certainly wouldn't expect the development team to lock themselves into a set release date at this point - but an estimated completion date would smooth out some of the issues I have with the game at the moment. The game has apparently been in development for almost two years, and there's no talk what so ever of when, or even if, the game will be available on popular digital marketplaces like Steam or Origin, which is a little worrying as it brings the question of how buyers might go about obtaining refunds if they aren't happy with the game. Finally, I'd like to point out to anyone reading this that I'm not trying to ""trash talk"" the developers or the kickstarter backers. I really like the ideas that this game represents, and I really want it to be a successful project and will be following the game's progress with a great amount of interest and think it will be a fantastic game when it's fully released."
general,Project Goals? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1488/project-goals,1142,2,2,NoBlackThunder,"Howdy LordBloodpool! So i want to put a small disclaimer here !!! Before i start. I was a backer long before i became sort of a member with a tag with my name that gives me (SLG Admin) but i wanted to comment you what made me decide to back eco back in the days since you concern is pretty valid and people should always think about before backing. So this reply will be my personal opinion i had back then and not an official reply from SLG. Just to point this out =) You are right with your first point! Lots of kickstarter projects get abandoned and some are eve there just to cheat people out of there money. That is sadly though one of the risk people have to take when backing projects there from small and unknown companies. Though there are some thinks people can do to have a higher chance to back project that will see it trough to the end. So let me make an example: I did some research back in the days when i originally was backing Eco. First of all is what games have been commercially released. At first look there are not that many for SLG yet But there is one game Called Vessel that even got very good reviews even though it got pretty few of these. You also have some other smaller projects. But for now Vessel is a very good example of the skills of SLG. This also tells you that SLG is at first glance not a company that starts a game and never delivers.  It really helps if a company has delivered at least one game that is good personally for me. Next question would be founding. We all know that most devs ask to little on kickstarter. Eco's initial KS goal was 100.000$ well that would give not allot of month of development time actually. KS got around 200.000$ in that would maybe cover 6 month of cost? maybe more ? I dont know how much it cost to run a company in a month but i am pretty sure that this cant be cheap. You have office cost, developers want to get payed and not minimum wage but a good payment too ( you need skilled people especially in small teams). So that seems to be to little right ? So what made me confident back then ? well its this article here that i read http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-09-introducing-eco-an-ecosystem-sim-where-everyone-must-nurture-the-same-planet. This has allot of talk about eco in school but also has a link to that eco got funding from the us government with a quite large amount. So pointing this out This also answers sort of your second question. This means you also have a rough estimate when eco should be done. That is somewhere in the second half of 2017. Now Estimating a release date is always impossible and dead lines are rarely kept since there is always something delaying a development. Anyway this means and also with our current official goal the 1.0 release should be around by the end of 2017. The plan is to keep on developing as long as its financial viable and keep on expanding eco (a bit like other games did ) Because there are so many more cool ideas that could have been added to eco but most likely wont make it into the final release at first. So i hope that gives you some insight why i backed eco back then and what made me decide to back it."

It lasts for about a 5-6 day period and the discussions range from cost, initial buy, to game mechanics and overall feelings about the game. I know its long to read (we go back and forth in chat often and our chat is verbose) but I think this is useful for everyone from current players and new players and even for the devs. I hope you get something useful out of this chat log... I'll put the TL:DR right up front! If you don't make it to the bottom of this chat log then at least takeaway this: we had concerns about the game and the price, but in the end we are pretty happy playing it and it was a decent buy. ===
So now I'll leave it to the chat log: I have bolded important sections of this log <Chat Log: Start> Gahx: do u want to try that eco game?
Gahx: not sure if im gonna like it but i want to at least tryFizzgig: its super grindy
Fizzgig: im not sure if i will like it
Fizzgig: but its also 40$ and im not sure if i can swing that for a bit
Fizzgig: but its made for mp
Fizzgig: itll be really tough with 2 or 3 ppl
Fizzgig: but its got some stuff right like limited carry capacity
Fizzgig: games sorta dont make sence that you can carry so much
Fizzgig: but this game is like one shovel full at a time of dirt or rubble or whatever and i think thats maybe too crazy
Fizzgig: atleast there should be a wheel barrow or something cuz if its trying to be realistic then we would atleast shovel things into a wheel barrow duh...not take one shovel
full at a time
Fizzgig: there is skills that increase capacity i think and there is skills for effeciency that reduce build requirements...but man super grindy idk Fizzgig: ok so a few things, i found out eco does have carts or wheel barrows so its not as stupid as i thought xD
Fizzgig: also i can actually afford it this month
Fizzgig: so idk if you wanna try it
Gahx: i didnt really want to buy eco i dont know if im gonna like itFizzgig: i saw a stream of it where ppl are farther along then ""first day"" and you can build some amazing stuff in itFizzgig: it is super grindy but it might be worth it
Fizzgig: i was really irritated seeing ppl carry shovels full of rubble one by one... but i found out there is a cart later you can load up
Fizzgig: also i dont think theres pvp in it. its supposed to be about community
Fizzgig: somebody needs this, they can give you this...the skills are hard to learn all by yourself so you have to work togetherGahx: i know the concept is coolGahx: i like the idea of leveling up different skills which help out the community
Gahx: i wonder if you have to restart if you go to another server
Fizzgig: each server is its own so yeah i think you have to restartGahx: they really ought to release a demo Gahx: i guess i do want to play eco xD
Gahx: the thing that i really enjoyed about FFXIV and RO and even ToS and Black Desert was the job system
Gahx: i like that everyone has a job and it effects the overall communityFizzgig: i just hope, if i spend that much money that i really will enjoy itFizzgig: i dont like grindy things usually and this is more grindy than most
Fizzgig: one thing about eco is that you gain skill points while offline
Fizzgig: as long as your nutrition is good
Gahx: lol you cant even get into eco yet
Gahx: you have to get a key or something
Fizzgig: yeah you can
Fizzgig: https://ecoauth.strangeloopgames.com/home
Gahx: heres the other thing....eco is another one of those really REALLY LONG games
Gahx: iv got so many of those running at the same time
Fizzgig: what i dont like is if you play on a server what happens if they take it down
Fizzgig: uh hey you rememebr that thing i built??  um...gone
Fizzgig: id want a server myself i think but i cant support a community
Fizzgig: my server box is too weak Gahx: i dont even know how to make tools yet lol
Gahx: im wandering around
Fizzgig: oh you got it?
Fizzgig: i guess ill get it too
Fizzgig: i think you get given a trade tool when you pick the skill Gahx: when it says you gain skillpoints per day is that in game day or rl day
Fizzgig: i think rl day
Gahx: ewww hope you can upgrade itFizzgig: having balanced nutrition increases the gain modifier
Fizzgig: and even when you log out it keeps ticking and getting skill point
Gahx: whoa something must be wrong lol
Gahx: i ate a beet and now it says skill points gained per day 41 Fizzgig: whats your coordinates?
Gahx: 936,600
Fizzgig: im almost there
Fizzgig: it was a trek Fizzgig: i guess i should put skills in axe pick shovel bow?
Fizzgig: but what about cooking?
Gahx: hold on dont put points into anything yet
Fizzgig: i put logging
Fizzgig: still have 3 pointsGahx: what you put points into determines what we can do
Fizzgig: well looging seems to be a must anyway
Gahx: we need to choose different skills
Gahx: i already have loggingFizzgig: its basic skill we both need
Fizzgig: so i got it too but i still have 3 points to spend Gahx: i dont really understand this game
Gahx: i need 5 points to go into carpentry
Gahx: but i only have 1 right nowGahx: so i just have to sit around and wait?
Fizzgig: if you eat better food then the gain goes up
Gahx: i cant even farm
Fizzgig: thats why we all need basic skills
Gahx: i really want to get into mining and smithing
Gahx: everyones gonna need tools xDFizzgig: were not gonna be able to take seperate skills
Fizzgig: not the early skillsFizzgig: but when we specialize in something then well do different ones
Fizzgig: but obiusely i want to build and mine and eat so we both are gonna have the same basic skills
Fizzgig: im also gonna take hunting
Fizzgig: so logging and hunting
Fizzgig: 2 points left Fizzgig: i think that that game needs a traditional xp system so you can work and level up and then use the auto gain for times when you are logged out
Fizzgig: but it is weird that you are stuck and cant do anything...it does seem to cut you off from playing Gahx: i want to see how many skill points i have nowGahx: i hope this game doesnt turn into a mobile type of game
Fizzgig: some of the craftables do take time like up to 5 mins
Gahx: gonna be kind of mad to pay 40$ for a game that is a glorified mobile game
Fizzgig: its gonna endup getting crazy modded so you dont have to worry xD Fizzgig: i think that after we eat cooked meals or food with lots of ingredients then well see skill modifyers into the 100s..perhaps 5-600 and stuff
Fizzgig: its hard to get there but basically we only ate a foriged item and it wasnt even cooked
Fizzgig: so its grindy in the begining until you get farther along or there is a real farming community that can provide better sorces of food
Gahx: i dont think you want to make people who are enthusiastic about playing not be able to playFizzgig: typical games have to fill up an xp bar doing monotinus tasks craft a million item that you dont need yey now youre ""good"" at this skill...yeah right there is no
benifit to the player by doing that
Fizzgig: so this it an attempt at removing that and just making it time based
Fizzgig: dont like the time? eat better food
Fizzgig: and you have to work hard to get there and spend alot of time to get it
Fizzgig: idk Gahx: just went on eco again i had 9 points
Gahx: immediately spent them and logged off
Gahx: thats kind of dumbFizzgig: youre not thinking about it right
Fizzgig: watch pauls vid he made today its called eco gangz
Fizzgig: the 4 of them played thay all had 0 points and they kept playing and goofing around hunting and building and everything
Fizzgig: your house is a box
Fizzgig: you could be on there chopping and building while your skills grow and then you wouldnt notice
Fizzgig: you would probobly also eat more and get skills faster than this
Gahx: i can only build a box
Gahx: i cant even make stairs
Fizzgig: so you leave the spot where the stairs go until you can make them and work on a different section
Fizzgig: we could build a huge town
Fizzgig: and forget everything about the skills while we work
Fizzgig: but eating will constantly get better skill gainFizzgig: its not as bad a spend and log out...but i do agree its weirdFizzgig: i was iffy on this game and this was one of the iffy things
Fizzgig: but watch pauls mp vid ... youll see what i mean Fizzgig: im not giving up on it yet, eating one raw beet and then complaining about skill gain doesnt seem right to me
Fizzgig: theres so much food that you could eat and make it better, we just dont have access to it yet
Gahx: thats not the problemGahx: the problem is the game stops you from playing early on for no reasonFizzgig: youre the one that is stoping playing, because you cant see some imaginary gainFizzgig: we could go in and play with what we have while waiting for better skills
Fizzgig: its slow..and its slow by design
Fizzgig: it is weird to adapt to this model but its not a completely wrong model
Fizzgig: its suposed to take time but doesnt stop you from playing
Fizzgig: i dont think the idea is fully fleshed out it is an alpha and things might change or get reballanced all of that is true Gahx: so i went on eco and that server we started on one guy gave me a book about mining so now i have mining skill and this other guy said i could take some food from his garden
Gahx: now im getting 50 points per day
Fizzgig: i logged in and i was completely starved and i cannot get food because i am so hungry
Fizzgig: we need to make a garden
Fizzgig: do you have any food left over?
Gahx: look in public storage
Gahx: i just put some in there
Gahx: we need some protein too
Gahx: theres some dead animals around if u can carve them
Fizzgig: i dont know if i can carve
Fizzgig: but we need to make a campfire we need 1 stone
Gahx: im mining come see if u can use your shovel on it
Fizzgig: so i need to get cooking skill
Gahx: do u have the laborer skill?
Fizzgig: yeah but i cant do anything
Fizzgig: too hungry to work
Gahx: kill some rabbits?
Fizzgig: the berrys only gave me 90 callories that i just spent trying to kill a turkey
Fizzgig: i cant shoot bow at 0 callories
Gahx: look in the campfire
Fizzgig: well where did you get those
Fizzgig: how do we get more?
Gahx: a guy said i could take them from his garden
Fizzgig: ok one thing i think we need is a research table
Fizzgig: it says lvl 2 crafting
Fizzgig: with that i think we can make a cooking scroll
Fizzgig: then i can learn to cook turkey
Gahx: i dont see research table unlocked by any skill
Fizzgig: its on the crafting bench but says requires crafting 2
Fizzgig: 20 logs 5 stone
Fizzgig: can you get crafting 2?
Fizzgig: then ill eat the berriwees so i can shovel the stone
Gahx: how much points is it? i have 0 right now
Fizzgig: its probly 3 pts
Fizzgig: first lvl is 1 pt then 2 lvl is 3
Gahx: ill get it when i get some points
Fizzgig: i cant do cooking until the cooking scroll is made
Fizzgig: so idunnoFizzgig: we probly didnt plan our points out right
Gahx: i told u that yesterday lol
Fizzgig: i mean i still think everybody should take basic skills
Fizzgig: we dont all have to become proficient but we should be able to do basic things
Fizzgig: i just dont want to eat all your berries if im not gonna be useful
Gahx: eat the berries and get 50 points per day
Fizzgig: ok i got it up to 34 pts
Gahx: did u leave the game?
Fizzgig: noFizzgig: i hunted turkey
Fizzgig: it says harvest it but i dont know how
Gahx: right click or E probably
Fizzgig: e did it
Fizzgig: ill try to get more turkey
Gahx: oh i should be looking for coal so we can actually use the campfire
Fizzgig: logs works too but coal lasts longer
Gahx: oh yea im cooking your turkey
Gahx: ohhh i have campfire cooking
Gahx: well my stomache is full xD
Gahx: oh yea keep bringing back meat xD
Gahx: 100 points per dayFizzgig: they are hard to shootFizzgig: but ill try to get another one
Fizzgig: i had to make more arrows
Fizzgig: hunting at night is useful
Fizzgig: they are sleeping i guess they dont run away from you Fizzgig: ok now we got a feastFizzgig: 4 rabits 1 turky 5 charred beets
Gahx: worst part is meat gives 600 calories
Gahx: im too full to eat meat
Fizzgig: then you need to work to spend the callories
Gahx: wow i had 12 points when i logged in
Gahx: dunno what to spend them on
Fizzgig: you should prbly just store them up until you need to do something with it
Fizzgig: you should make carts
Gahx: im trying to figure out how
Fizzgig: or get the skills needed to make them
Fizzgig: also higher lvl skills are gonna start costing quite alot
Fizzgig: lvl 3 in something takes 9 i could see it costing 30+ for lvl 4 or something
Fizzgig: dont even want to think about what it takes at lvl 10Fizzgig: we also need coal for fuel i want to stop burning the wood
Fizzgig: it seems like stone is the most abundant resource so that should bue our building material as soon as we can <Chat Log: End>"

But for now it is to help you decide and make sure that we get more involved players than just people buying eco and never touching it again.

Once you open the mini map to see which plots of land aren't claimed, you lag immensely, and I'm not saying a few frames per second drop, it literally makes the game unplayable even on the fastest settings. At this point, having the mini map up is a sure way to crash your game to desktop having it out too long. Why do you have to have an animated view of the world, why couldn't you have a simple map, flattened out to alleviate the lag when it's brought up? The map is pretty, but it's unnecessary to have when you're navigating as most don't need to see the rendered trees, the rocks, and the water rendered on a map. Just make the option to have an automated map if they want it, and flatten out the map for those that don't need the extra shiny to play. I'm not running a super high end computer, but i have a fx 6300 clocked at 3.5 gigs per core, 8 gigs of 1866mhz ram, and a hybrid ssd/hhd drive.. You would think at the fastest settings the game should fly with my current configuration. But nope, if i was to gauge the fps with the fastest settings, it's somewhat playable, around 15-18 fps on average and 1-2 fps when mini map is up. hell creativerse with max settings allows me to run at 55 fps, so not exactly sure what you're doing. Also you should have the option on the server list to hide incomplete and outdated servers, this looks bad when new people purchase the game and see only a handful of running servers, yet see a wall of incompatible servers, this shows that people are not playing it anymore, looks bad for your game. Which if you were to utilize the scroll wheel on the mouse to navigate the server list, people will eventually give up and want their money back in frustration. Another issue is this ""inactivity bug"" which is really getting old fast. You can be playing, digging, actually working, and you're logged off for inactivity, which not only happens once, but you can be building, terra-forming land, or could be farming, and you're logged for inactivity, and it's happening on a lot of servers, not just a select few."
general,Alpha 5.3 Released | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1282/alpha-5-3-released,8334,20,4,Gronknor,"OK i tested it with msi afterburner. I needed a decent fps and GPU monitoring program to test this. Not exactly sure why I've literally lost 3/4 of my fps when the mini map is up, but that's ridiculous! I've been testing it throughout both versions of 32 bit and 64 bit to see which of the versions seem to be the most stable of the ladder.  For now, 64 bit isn't truly optimized, the 32 bit version runs pretty dang hot with medium settings. Which shouldn't be the case because 32 bit should be bottle necking the graphics and should cap out GPU usage cause it's not needed to render all of the graphics. So not sure why the 32 bit vers is harder on the GPU, when it shouldn't be. I can bet if ran for a solid hour on a low grade laptop, you'll be able to fry an egg on the bottom side of that laptop easily ha ha. I think i'll return to this game when it's not to glitchy when trying to play. As for now, with the graphical settings, it's not worth overheating a graphics card to render the garbage mini map to find your friends on the map. Another thing, how in the bloody hell can someone claim land that you own right out from under you, take all of the stuff you own, and say it was never claimed, yet i don't have ANY claim stakes, and i had the land for several days prior. there is no way to ban them from servers, remove their stuff, or anything.

That is the only difference between 5.2 and 5.3, with regards to the minimap. The minimap UI element has many parts, and we're addressing bottlenecks one at a time, as we are able."

They're not dead, but somehow they are alive. Some said if they shoot the rag doll of the elk, they've found a body nearby which you can loot (carcass) - not on the location of the rag doll.

We're using dirt roads btw - i can test (and modify this post) if it is any different with other road types. Other then that the carts seem to function properly - just the avatar in the road thingy. Even after picking up and such. You probably also know this but we're getting deeds every time you pick up the cart and put it down again. I'm aware a rework is going on. An other strange thing is; newly grown trees have the same amount of wood then fully grown trees (or at least too much imo). Is this going to change in the future? Even the very small trees have somewhat the same amount - it's just a smaller surface you need to hit on. Last thing that i find strange - might need a rework as well. If you want to claim property, you also claim the property above you. I'm building inside a mountain and i just want to claim my room so no one can break it down - but on top of the mountain the land also tells me it's 'my land', even when i only claimed the room inside the mountain - in my house. Same issue with someone else nearby - can't build anything because someone claimed a plot underneath it / half in the mountain, which results in him not able to build anything on top of the mountain anymore. Carpentry: Seems like the table, shelve and chairs don't spread their effect. The crafting tables have got the requirement + they say there's modules, but i can't seem to get the crafting time/cost down. I've tried replacing the table but doesn't seem to work either. It also doesn't work for the carpentry bench itself (in case there was a typo in the description). Maybe the described time in the table doesn't count the reductions in, but the actual time is reduced, idk? Client seems very stable, haven't had a lot of crashed - even the server crashed more then i had regular crashes lol. Bow's back and i can see other avatars, yay! Nice hotfix so far. :)"

I think not. Not everyone has the money for a rig like the one you have, so, the 64 bit optimization wouldn't be a bad thing. Not saying the game doesn't run at all, but if they're planning on hitting the steam market, they're going to have a lot of problems in the future if they can't hit the mid end market with their requirements, it'll just hurt them, but hey, maybe you can purchase them a new card so they can test with you :p (joking aside)."

I recently joined under the dev license and have taken up this mantle.  Fixing client-side graphics performance isn't something that's done by ramping up the specs on your rig - video or CPU.  It's requires specific engineering in the client code to improve, and you don't want to do it too early in the development process because optimized code can be harder to work with than code which is easier to understand but slower.  Remember the game is still changing quite a bit, and making that harder now just to get some more FPS hurts the entire development process. But, to set the record straight, there are absolutely framerate perf issues, we absolutely know where and why, they can and are being fixed in code (and I am not even touching the shaders, so everyone will benefit), and they do not require you to buy a better rig.

I have an older rig that runs this game flawlessly...and this rig is 4 years old.  My stance is make sure you're crap isn't the issue before crying BUGS!  If my rig isn't experiencing FPS problems same should apply elsewhere.  If the game works for 5 people and 4 orhers are crashing etc...the problem isn't with the game.

If you spend a lot of time in the same area, you will tend not to see the performance problems nearly as badly as someone who roams the world.  If you have a larger view range that will also significantly impact your performance, especially if your machine happens to have slower memory, less memory or a slower CPU no matter what video hardware/drivers you have.  Trying to diagnose performance problems without doing an inspection of the running environment and the code probably won't lead to satisfaction this early in the product cycle."

Going forward I expect we will keep a steady eye on performance as more and more people will hear about the game and a good first impression will become increasingly important.  But right now it's really geared toward those who are wanting to help advance development - people who will find and report bugs, help with game balance, and generally help a very small team to accomplish what we think is a really cool goal in a reasonable timeframe.  If you don't want to be in this early, you probably shouldn't have joined, but if you stick around, I promise things will get a lot better, but you'll need some patience in the mean time. And by the way, your rig specs wouldn't have really helped you with the performance issues so take heart (the problems were beyond fixing with better hardware).  I have a pretty good rig myself (i7, 32Gb, 980Ti running at 4k) and I get nice framerates now even at max world distance.

Any help would be appreciated."
general,How do trades/stores work? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1328/how-do-trades-stores-work,1800,3,2,Freds00n,"You'll have to check what is on the left and what is on the right side. The left side is for sale, the right side is what the shop is buying.
Example: If there's one chair on the left side and the it says ""5"" and on the right side there's a log saying ""1"", you will basically have to gather 5 points by giving the store... 5 logs. Just put in the number of logs or hold them in your hand, what ever is easiest. You can also see the amount of points you've earned or lack in the right bottom corner of the shop screen. If it's green you're able to buy it or have points left, if it's red you still owe points/items. That's basically how shops work. ALWAYS make sure you're at 0 or close to and don't click trade if you're not ready because you might lose your stuff / the shop takes it without you gaining smth.  :) If you want to set up a shop yourself you can scale prices accordingly; scale left side to 20 and scale right side to 1 (for expensive items - need lots of items to buy it) or scale left to 1 and right to 5 (for resources or redundant items - need a few to buy a lot). You can also store goods in the shop, there is a private section for you and all your customers. If you want to sell goods you'll put it in the store section - there will also be all the items your customers give you in case someone buys you stuff. Important: if you want to remove it and it says 'someone has been using it or has items in it', don't believe the first part. Someone has 100% items in it and if he/she clears their private section you'll be able to pick it up. Just try let people have specific jobs and only one job - so that not everyone is a chef or an engineer or... this is the only way you can create an economy. Don't craft boards but let someone be a carpenter who can craft them 100x better. So you kind of need to let people do their thing and you do your thing, otherwise it doesn't work if everyone is just doing everything on their own - even simple things like boards. Or just help out some new guys - give them wood for the berries they collected or smth! That's it basically, hope this helps. :)"

Like, the concept of your diet influencing your ability to perform is a very cool idea but I can't starve to death, take fall damage and nothing seems to be openly hostile towards me. Also I just seem to magically obtain items out of thin air by leaning a skill. Is there some sort of reason that you don't learn skills by performing the relevant actions? Or making tools by going out and gathering the materials required, first by hand and then by primitive tools? Because that's literally what makes survival games fun. I'm not trying to be negative I'm just totally perplexed by what I've logged into and slightly worried I've just sunk $40 into something completely different to what I expected."
general,Hmmm... =/ | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1374/hmmm,2812,8,2,ChronosWS,"(NOTE: this is my personal view of the game, not an official SLG response) First, the game is in alpha - not even beta so there are still many features unfinished or maybe not even present.  Second, survival in this game currently means surviving as a group against certain natural disasters (currently a meteor impact, but planned are other kinds of disasters.)  Unlike most other ""survival"" sandbox games, individual survival is not a major feature of the base game.  You won't find monsters, you won't die of starvation, you won't drown... yet.  Again, the survival aspect here is one of working together to ensure survival against a more complex threat than a skeleton invading your home. Rethought in those terms, the skill system is designed to encourage specialization and not to reward people grinding out skills to ""advance"" in a personal sense.  Skill points are earned over time (like Eve Online) but the amount earned is based on food.  Assuming one works collectively with their friends, a division of labor will let someone produce nutritious food while others gather supplies (for food or other things), and everyone will benefit.  Again, think collectively. So, to the extent that the initial game is focused heavily on collective effort and survival on a larger scale, this game differs substantially from Minecraft and similar survival sandbox games.  A more single-player focused mode has been talked about and been requested many times - such a mode may come about later, but the current focus is on the core scenarios. One other major feature which will affect the play experience is the creation of a comprehensive mod system.  Such a system would allow someone to add a more extensive combat system, more animals/monsters and other kinds of systems to the game.  Server operators should be able to spin up worlds with very different rules and goals, and I would be astonished if there was not a drive to create a more traditional survival-type game in the vein you are imagining.  I'd advise staying tuned in to what is going on and providing input on the survival and other game play aspects which interest you.  The development team has been very responsive and receptive to constructive suggestions, and development is very active.  Your $40 is not wasted if you are willing to stay engaged.  Or, wait for the mod system to become fully fleshed out and engage mod makers to get your ideas implemented. I hope that helps."
general,Hmmm... =/ | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1374/hmmm,2812,8,3,evanpage,"Thanks for the response. I really don't want to come across as just being negative - everything about this game has so much potential. I've had my eye on this since I first heard of it and have been really excited to see it come to fruition. I think it's so important for us to build a bridge between interactive platforms (such as gaming) and educational experiences. I myself am a student studying a Bachelor of Urban and Environmental Planning with a real motivation into looking at using interactive media as a means of bridging a gap between recreation and education (because honestly most educational games out there are seriously boring). I was actually pretty tempted to buy the developer access package, but alas I am a poor student and can't really afford it. I'll definitely keep giving it a go. I really want to like this game. It's just too bad the server I picked has no one on it so I've spent the last 4 days (in-game) running around doing nothing but watching a skill bar slowly increase lol"
general,Hmmm... =/ | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1374/hmmm,2812,8,4,Dimestore,"Another point you might notice with the game in its current Alpha state is that it provides a lot of mechanisms to support effective teamwork.
If someone has researched a technology it shows as a greyed out item in your skill tree so you know that you can trade for it instead of having to research it yourself.
The store item provides the ability to set up pretty complex economic transactions without requiring both people to be online at the same time.
The default settings in the game explicitly balance so that no one person can learn everything in time to stop the asteroid: teamwork is required.
The Election, Laws, etc systems provide a further framework for cooperation. I would strongly suggest checking out some of the servers you see listed and look for one either early in play that is willing to help a new player (common but not everywhere) or is well established so you can build yourself up through trade instead of having to fumble through early stages of learning. if you want, Nesphit has put together a very good ""Getting Started"" guide. I forget the link but you can search for his name or just go to the SGL server where he has placed a sign in the middle of the central village workshop listing the address. Best wishes,

You can find that guide here http://eco.gamepedia.com/Getting_Started I am sorry to her you thought Eco was something different. There are many reasons why you might have thought it was different then what you thought it was. There have been some good comments on your thoughts and we value every feedback even the one that you give us. That helps us learn in the future and shows us that we might need more sources that can make clear what eco is and what eco is not. So skills, you are asking why you are not getting skills by grinding like many other games?  Eco tries to do it differently but nothing new, Actually eco system is a bit similar to what eve online does, passive skill learning even when you are offline. John(the creator of eco) dint want people to grind for skills like chopping down 2000 trees to be able to learn logging, if everyone wants to do that then this is an issue. On top of that is that this skill system gives food a more meaningful implementation, it also reflects a bit more the real world. You are not learning new skills without the right food. If you would just eat bread and drink normal water your body would lack important vitamins etc and you will in  real life learn much slower. You also dont need always to perform an action X amount of times to become good. A person can get in real life better at electrical things by just reading allot of books etc than a person just slapping randomly a cable onto the wall. Its a different approach than most other games to, Its kind of realistic without compromising to much of the simulation but still keeping thinks fun to play with. So i hope even though its not exactly what you thought it would be that i still will give you joy and fun in the future."

I've listened to the advice of the above replies and kept playing. Honestly I think it was just culture shock coming into a system that I've never really encountered before and compounded by the fact I was honestly expecting something else. But I'm glad I stuck with it because I'm finding that I actually really like the system you have in place as it really plays into the fundamental promotion of teamwork that this game is about.The only problems I have now are obviously results of the game being in Alpha which I'm sure will be addressed in the future (birds flying in the ocean, unable to drop items from inventory etc). Minor bugs aside it is true that this game wasn't exactly what I was expecting. It's actually something totally different and unique and upon giving it a chance something I am happy to have invested my money in. My only regret is not being able to purchase the developer access tier but if I get the opportunity I might look at upgrading my account. I've had my eye on this game for a long while now as I am studying Urban and Environmental Planning and really want to try and do something that brings interactive media and education together in an engaging and sophisticated way. As someone who spent most of their younger years buried in gaming and not really engaged with the reality beyond, I think that there's a chance to make a real difference in people's lives and subsequently the world in general by working on concepts like this. I'd actually offer the suggestion on placing even more emphasis on the educational aspects of the game, like having visually representable food webs and species information, information on how C02 emissions have an impact on the Greenhouse Effect etc. I might flesh these suggestions out a bit more and drop them in the relevant thread."

Great responses Chronos/nbt/dimestore, covers my thoughts exactly.  We're going for something really unique here, there's a lot of design in this game that's never been tried in a game, so we're breaking new ground.  With that goal, the voxels and survival elements are useful in giving the player a foundation, something they're familiar with and understand that the crazy things we're doing can attach to.  So, we diverge from those standard survival practices where it suits our core goals: simulating a 'tragedy of the commons', making social challenges the focus of solving environmental destruction, and giving players a window into their own biases and those of others.  And as Chronos pointed out, there's a lot of the game still to be built. Thanks for the feedback!"

general,The Price | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1316/the-price,1523,5,1,snakedoc,"Hello to all the players, devs and other staff, At first the game looks great from what i have seen on youtube and screenshots, also the type of gameplay is a nice choice something completely new for me. (the eco system) Now you have read the title of my post, and am not the first one that says someting about the price, 40 bucks for a early acces game? i have read the reactions that you guys try to sort out the casual player  vs the player that really wants to help with testing / errors and bug. What i can understand. But from my part its a bit strange... i buy a few EA games that interests me because i like to help out the devs, and more importent i like to play the game at a stage thats not complete, so you can find bugs and report them. It's one big puzzle game, if you find a bug! can you duplicate it, and so how ? and if you start a new save file will that same bug come along. Thats the most fun for me as a EA game supporter / player. As for me (and i think more ppl are with me) i dont have any problems to put in time, find bugs, make a bug report. But to do that you need a key, 40 bucks for me euros ok its money but still. This game you need to play with more ppl so i need to buy atleast 2 keys so also for me for the fun but also becuse its part of the gameplay. So 2 times 40 buck = 80 bucks wait there  is a option to buy 2 for 70 so i pay 35 a key ^^. ok now i can play and test the game my self and get help / support from my wife, friends or daughter sometimes. But now the other part... i need to pay 70 buck becuse i like to find bugs, and help out a EA game. The time is no problem becuse of my health i can do much on a day so i have a few hours a day to spare. But that a side i think it helps if the price drops a bit, so that more ppl can help you guys out. I keep follow you guys and the game i see a great potential. Greetzzz snakedoc A little late but happy 2017"
general,The Price | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1316/the-price,1523,5,2,Freds00n,"Hey Snakedoc! As a tester myself i sort of know what you mean. They do want to sort out the players but imo that's not even the reason for having a high price. I'm going to be honest here; this is probably one of the biggest EA games out there that is probably 70% functional in all it's ways. Sure, it is EA after all, there are bugs. But i've been playing for almost a week now and even i am still discovering new things on a daily basis just because the game is that big already. The main issue about youtubers is: they play the game too casually. Most likely you've watched guys play for the first time and (unfortunately) also play alone instead of on a public server / with other guys (preferably atleast 5-10 active ppl). The game comes alive once you join a public server. I've been on one now and i literally spend 2 IRL days building a huge road through mountains and such to reach one guy so we are all connected to each other. Like half of the active community even participated in building the road and eventually we're all glad it's there because we can drive around with our powered cars through the mountains. :)
There are a lot of citizens who just join for once, don't even say ""Hi"" in chat and probably leave within 10 minutes. But once you get a small community going you can divide jobs; one can be the cook, one can do the woodcutting, the other can do the smelting, he can do the farming (all do bugged...),... it goes on and on. THIS is what ALREADY is in the current alpha, and suprisingly enough most of it works properly! We have at least 5 - 6 people having a completely different job on our server and together we cooperate to gain more research for better skills and create things together. We also have two small cities going on - me being the 'mayor' of the biggest one and we just started building a road to the other to city to connect even more people. Thing is it also focuses towards realism so you have to watch things like overhunting, pollution, extinction of plants, tree population,... so you must change your gameplay constantly to the changing stats of your server's ecosystem to preserve all life. We have a wolf population of 15 (which is very low). With an active community of 5 - 6 people you could easily extinct them in one day - so we made a law: don't hunt wolves! I'm also about to make a law so everyone cuts down their tree stumps so trees will continue to grow on their own. Game is rather complex as it is - once you get the hang of it everything falls in place. This is just that kind of game that you simply don't play on yourself or with your best friend. Go out there! Find a nice server, say hi, stay and build a nice hut - build a city, have an amazing time. I'm already making new friends here, so should you! I'm 100% advising you to do so to get the fullest out of Eco. After all, if you really don't like the price you can find others to do a group purchase because the bundle is cheaper / person. Again a good way to make new friends and start the game properly.   :) See ya in-game! Freds00n"

Great reply and a good post, i see your points and i think you are right at some points.

general,Sale? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1151/sale,3706,7,4,NoBlackThunder,The idea behind the 40$ right now is to have Eco sort of limited.

general,Sale? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1151/sale,3706,7,7,ArtisL,I fully support this idea.  I strongly believe this game is going to be huge.  I'm a teacher in a school in the UK.  I currently run Minecraft servers for the pupils so they can interact in a safe way.  The scope having servers for the pupils is huge.  They really respond well to implementing games into their education plans.  As an educator I feel strongly that we are missing out on a big thing with games and education.  Most games just don't consider the benefit they can have. I have zero issue with paying more to help this game develop.  My only wish is that it is released to steam EA only when it as lots of features and less buggy.  Please do not rush this into EA.  The potential is very real. Also I know for sure that schools in the UK will pay for more than the $500 asking price for 100 keys :) Just a heads up.

I am writing to inquire about a somewhat simple question thats on my mind. Being a seasoned player many different real time and historical strategy games, as well as minecraft and its modded offshots, I simply wonder - is this game any fun yet? The concept sounds really interesting, but are the servers good enough yet, and do you have enough content for us to enjoy the game for any protracted period of time? I have no question that I will eventuall join in, but I do not want to spoil the experience. I think the concept of adding some governance to the traditional minecraft-esque experience could really differentiate this game from all the similar games. Do that part well, and I think this would be the next huge thing. Additionally, It would be great to know if it does work on Mac - since someone I wish to play with swear to that OS.

However, to answer your question, if you are looking for a fun experience my advice would be to wait a bit longer. Progress is being made every day in this game, but right now it is still in a rough state performance and feature-wise. A lot of the core features are non-functional. This includes agriculture, much of the late-game tech, and the whole governance/law/justice system. Carts are a major source of frustration as they are necessary to gameplay, yet sometimes behave erratically, like they are possessed, resulting in loss of items and other inconveniences. That said, the game is quite pretty, and you can have a lot of fun building houses out of various materials. It's just a lot harder than in Minecraft. It's a lot better if you have friends to play with. And as far as Mac support goes, this appears to be something that the devs care a lot about (they just fixed a major graphical issue on Macs), and I assume the reason is the educational market. Lots of classrooms use Macs."

general,Working on wiki - Feedback wanted | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1235/working-on-wiki-feedback-wanted,3172,8,1,Nes,"Hi everyone! I've been spending a perhaps inordinate amount of time on the wiki. Since the game mechanics are going to probably change a lot with every release, my goal has been to get the structure and style consistent to be ready for future updates. That way when people want to update info, they can do so within the framework that is already on the page. I've also been working on a guide to updating the wiki. See it here: eco.gamepedia.com/Help:Guide To sum up that guide, basically, all items and all skills should have their own page. The wiki should have a focus on ""nexus"" pages, which are consolidated guides to certain aspects of the game. Many pages should become redirects or contain ""See also"" references to these nexus pages. Examples of item pages (one for each item type): Example of skill page: Nexus pages (most still incomplete): I think that about covers it. Any feedback is appreciated. Is there anything that could be done better? Remember, every one of us can edit this. Don't be shy in adding content. It can always be added later and something is almost always better than nothing. And if you're wondering why I'm doing this: I'm an unemployed copy editor who loves ECO. Call me anal-retentive, or OCD, or whatever, but I've actually enjoyed building the wiki and trying to get everything ""just so"". I'll probably slow down on the editing in the new year seeing as things have been pretty much set up."

general,Working on wiki - Feedback wanted | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1235/working-on-wiki-feedback-wanted,3172,8,3,ChronosWS,Are you building the individual skill/item pages by hand?  I'd imagine these might be best to populate from a database produced by the releases and then have a template applied to them.

I'm still 50/50 though in terms of whether my system can handle it and how toxic it will allow players to be? The worst thing we've probably all found with online games of this nature is that people love to destroy as much as they can, particularly when it comes to bases.  I'm wondering how protected our homes would be ? it's incredibly disheartening to log back on and find someone has randomly destroyed everything you built for no real reason other than the potential joy they feel at griefing. In my experience the online community is fairly toxic unless you're with friends, what safeguards are there? The laws look good and are a very nice idea - but I assume it will just come down to the server rules?  As a rule of thumb I tend to play with 5-6 friends and we build our little projects together, but it would be nice to know there's something bigger that we can join and enjoy without someone destructive barreling through everything that's been created. Love the concept though!"

...Unintended and Intended griefing will be a massive issue. ECO just changes the board, you don't grief other players... you ""grief"" the world. Bunch of new players easily savage the world out of resources before even understanding how the game is meant to be played (unintentional grief), and the intentional one will likely be still against the world to affect all the players on the world. The laws can be a double-edge sword for me; after a world starts and laws start getting approved, all new players that join the server will face one harsher start; imagine tree limitation laws with a new player trying to build the starter hut... can take days."
general,How Anti-Grief is Eco? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1089/how-anti-grief-is-eco,14038,22,4,panisch,"exactly what maxbacon said.
killing any sort of plant or animal towards extinction, polluting oceans, rivers, the world. these are things (and this isnt a complete list) that new players could do while they try to figure out how the game works, before they even begin to realize that a mistake could have been done.
this is unintentional. the intentional grief would be all this but amplified both in intensity and rapidity. claims?
you cant claim the entire world and for a longterm game it's the entire world you need to protect and not just your backyard. laws?
laws help to some extent, but can also backfire pretty hard. ive seen a server trying to save camas from extinction by limiting camas harvest, which essentially disabled camas from the game, because you couldnt harvest them effectively to make use of em. just one example. laws in its current state are obtainable too late, permanent and exceptionless. even with a team that knows what it's doing you need a couple of days to be able to set laws. by then your world could be ruined. gov/admins should be able to remove laws. but most importantly: laws need to be more dynamic. why am i restricted to harvest 1 camas a day when i made my very own camas farm of 100 blocks on my own property? you can kill 5 elks per day BUT ONLY IF you have hunting yield rank 3, otherwise you are allowed to kill 1 elk per day. nobody is allowed to cut any trees down.. unless they planted equal amounts of tree seeds that day. just some examples of how dynamic laws could look like. IMO without grief protection (intentional or not) this should not go into early access/steam. public servers would likely be dead within 2 days. everyone would whitelist their servers. new players would have a harder time finding active servers. honest players would get frustated very fast. it would overall be a bad start for the public community and for some that sticks. the current community is small, i have not met anyone who deliberately tried to destroy anything. most players are open to the aspect of preserving the ecosystem and are trying to work together to achieve this.
but i also have played enough of these kind of games to know that not everyone wants to play the same way. some like to exploit resources without looking back.. or further than the next day and it's their right to do so... but maybe they shouldnt have that right on every server.
and then ofc there are the kind of people that like to intentionally destroy things just because. so.. to get to the tl:dr:
bugfixes and content are important, but the permission mechanics (just gonna call it that for now) needs some love too!"
general,How Anti-Grief is Eco? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1089/how-anti-grief-is-eco,14038,22,5,MaxBacon,"@panisch yeah needs to exist ways to fight that back before the player base is expanded, so stuff can be kept stable. I think the game firstly needs a learning curve for new players be introduced and understand the game and the objective of what they are doing; that will help. The learning curve is important. More specific griefing stuff will be a more complex matter, there's many ways to do something even without impacting any claims, simply impacting the world; so not sure what is going to happen there. I can imagine on this game servers will be more restricted in access to maintain the best stability."
general,How Anti-Grief is Eco? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1089/how-anti-grief-is-eco,14038,22,6,Baneofpuppies,"I agree with you guys-it seems like there's a huge potential for grief in ECO, intentional or unintentional. I've started to play on several servers, only to realize that an entire resource is extinct (like wheat...). It can totally throw off a game. It seems like the law system and the property system are the ways to address that right now-one of the points of ECO is to created a sort of miniature society within the game. It's very similar to real life, in that way. Perhaps one option is to make servers that are initially whitelisted with a core team, but then become open to the public. That way certain laws are established and resources are cultivated before potential griefers enter the world. That could give some breathing room and help mitigate the damage from those who may mean ill. Another way could be to make the world bigger. Not sure if there's a direct correlation between world size and the speed with which resources re-populate currently--but if so, that's a great way to cushion damaging effects of new/mean players. On the other hand, that might kind of defeat the purpose of learning how to live in balance with an ECOsystem. On the other hand, maybe it would help balance the beginning of the game and make the late-game more difficult. One way to mitigate unintentional damage is to create a tutorial/training for new players; although I'm sure that's planned for the future. The classroom would be a great environment to introduce the concepts of conservation before the beginning of a game.
However it happens, I think ECO will make it very interesting to solve these problems."

Make a huge (Well not huge if you don't want it to be) area that you claim, and use it as an area where no one can kill them. Then, you can sell the seeds at a tremendous profit of stuff, then soon after that, THE ENTIRE WORLD might HAVE A BUNCH OF WHEAT BACK! :D I think this isn't a bad idea"
general,How Anti-Grief is Eco? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1089/how-anti-grief-is-eco,14038,22,8,Baneofpuppies,"@Cute-Little-Froggy  haha yes, that is an idea that is actually well executed in society today. The biggest farming corporations in the world make huge profits off the sale of food to the rest of the world.
I think one of the useful lessons ECO can teach is how driving up your prices for profit can affect the world around you. If people can't afford what you sell, or they just barely get by, that might not be enough to help society advance in order to prevent the next natural disaster.
In ECO, there has to be a balance between hording plants for your own profit and making them available to all other players so that the world can advance together.
That said, I think that growing wheat on your own farmland can indeed help prevent it from being destroyed...if you can do it in time!"

That way people don't quick hop to servers and ruin the ecosystem then jump onto the next etc.  and it shows a certain amount of dedication to the whole process which is surely the point. I like the idea of claim flags - do you have different types? like if there's a law about harvesting but you claim a 'farmland plot' which means you can't make a fancy house beyond a little cottage but do have room to grow your crops or trees etc. and bypass limitation laws as you'd own the land?  If not it could be something quite nifty like claiming forestry plots then applying for grants and so begin contributing to the server economy.  I can see some servers really taking off and people forming trade alliances, lobbying for laws to increase land allocations/farming methods (What do you mean I can't have a nuclear powered juggernaught harvester?)/tech limitations - there's so much potential here!"

Learning what is right, and wrong (Pollution wise) If they do something wrong, they learn and then they learn how not to pollute. And the ""Oh people will pollute intentionally"" Will not matter, because a tutorial will not help, it just shows them how to do the opposite. But I get what you mean, and it's good in theory. But not everyone is perfect (In not griefing deliberately)"
general,How Anti-Grief is Eco? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1089/how-anti-grief-is-eco,14038,22,14,Rival,That's very true and I'm just speaking from experience and what turns me off MMOs more than anything is people going out of their way to make something decent into something toxic.  I just think if you have to invest a bit of time at the start in some way before you're allowed to properly go into the world like a 'gated' project then the majority of short attention span troll types won't bother and you're more likely to get people who actually want to try something as a community.

What would also be just as fun is if said person broke say 2/3 laws, it would allow anyone else to go over to their claim and destroy it. To keep this fun though the person braking the laws should also be able to defend their claim. Now I know this might annoy the hell out of players who want a more PVE role, but a server setting or description of this in the server lists would be nice. On the last server I played on I wanted to harvest all the important wild plant life then just sell it, as the player base is very low I quickly realised this was a bad idea, felt bad and ended up planting needed resources close to spawn."

I think that ECO is the type of game where you're going to need to learn a lot and use your knowledge well in order to thrive. There's merit in having a tutorial-type introduction to new players on your server, but people who want to destroy will just destroy.
I think that's one of the points of the proposed 'criminal justice' system, where players can be held responsible for their actions before they get out of hand. If a player breaks a couple of laws, then other players will have the ability to throw them into a jail or something."
general,How Anti-Grief is Eco? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1089/how-anti-grief-is-eco,14038,22,17,midn8t,theirs other issues also with the laws also  but these are issues I ran into on servers I have played on and hosted publicly. number one issue i ran into is me and my friends run our own server I had it setup for public see if people would join there 5 of us who play friend wise well group of 6 came on passed bunch laws limiting people to only being able to collect 1 of each thing per 24 hour period. well law was passed and that was it that was law i had wipe the whole world and start over. this could happen on servers that are not controlled by you or your group so people could go on a server and get really bitch slapped with the laws. most people who play this game now and run there own servers and play in small groups tend to also white list so random people can not get on. that means alot of servers now only run with 1 2 or 3 4 people. there anther issue with public servers every time someone logs on and creats a person they get counted as pop even if there not really playing on server so you see servers with pop of like 20 or 30 people but only have 1 or two or 5 players constant. then people also just log in and grab claims around peoples homes making it so they cant do stuff then they leave never to play again. I think if game world was large enough mutil community could be great thing where different community have different laws in same world that would better represent the world as a whole in real life and it would also help with one of issues with people using laws to hurt others deliberately.. the other thing for breaking laws  the community who had there law broken should be able to fine that person with auto tax fro example you cut down 10 trees two many 70% of seeds you collected go to that town. or maybe death where you can order person to death and they have to start all over at start level zero and they lose  control of all there stuff. throwing people in jail in this game for a x amount of time does not may not matter in this game due to fact that it rewards people for not playing it hands out skill points when your off line so people would just be like o well i am in jail big deal ill get out with more skill points anyways. if you had to earn skill points by playing game this might be different. because then time not playing means your not gaining experience meaning g your not learning anything and your able to do anything new latter on.

Previously, anytime we were to make a change to the serializer schema such as adding a new item, renaming an item, deleting items etc, this caused full server wipes.  With 5.2, this should no longer occur. In order to fully test this functionality it would be incredibly useful to test using a variety of peoples existing servers.  So if any of you are running a server and can email me your Game.eco file (located under Server/Storage), I can do some additional tests and make sure everything is good."

Q1: Can someone explain to me how the ""Currently Overpopulated!"" works exactly? I have some Cedar seeds that I want to plant near my house but is says ""1 Cedar per 20x20 block (Currently 2 competing plants) I assume by ""competing plants"" it refers to other trees, right? The problem is I'm pretty sure there are no other trees in such block. Is it referring to grass? If so, shouldn't the number of competing plants be wayyyy bigger (grass is everywhere)? Q2: what is the ""projected max yield"" and what is the ""overall growth rate""? Is it referring to the max logs the tree will eventually produce? Is the Growth rate referring to the speed the tree will grow OR the maximum growth it can reach? (perhaps land occupied by other plants does not allow trees to grow too big?)"

I do know right now farm trying to grow anything other then trees just does not seem to work. I am wondering if competing plants means just plants in general competing over same water source ? i have been experimenting with  irrigation - each block has a moisture percentage and that is how much water is in block - each planet needs so much water aka moisture. so far I have no been able to get moisture of a block to in cress not even putting dirt block under water and letting it sit there has also failed. so I am not sure how you get water to the planets to the blocks. ? digging itch and running water next to block also has failed to in cress it. in my own test anyways. ? I think more planets there are the lower moisture in ground areas suppose to be but I have not been able to confirm that ether.? this subject i started has same question as you some what i think like i said all planet farming issues comes from water issues I think but I am not sure - but I do know if i cant get moisture level to in-cress in the blocks then I wont be able to farm or plant anything or get anything to grow so anyways this url shows couple of experiments i did I took picture also, there is a developer that was responding to this topic on this url also - http://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com:4567/topic/1222/5-1-water-irrigation-bug"

So I am in an area where wheat naturally grows, so I figured I could farm wheat. After clearing out a plot infront of my house, bordering it with road, hoeing it. It seems the grass spreads at an unnaturally fast pace back into the hoe'd area. As well, it seems everytime I plant wheat seeds, they plants die (even after freshly clearing out the grass that grows by shovelling it out and re-placing the dirt). Is there something I am missing about farming? I understand matching the Moisture/Temperature rates, but even at a 50% growth rate, my seeds die out within the day they are planted. And yet, the wheat is growing wild nearby in the grass just fine. Ive also tried clearing that wheat within 10 blocks of the perimeter of the field."

I recall someone was working on one in the wiki during 4th and Nes is working on one for 5th.  I have to give him my food info cause he had asked. It's easiest to say it's a bit of everything.  But it's a formula that takes the average nutrients from everything currently within your stomach and totals them up to get your skill points per day as well as the bonus modifier.  This means that something with high nutrients is ""usually"" better, but that having balanced nutrients for the bonus multiplier matters as well. Created foods have better averages (generally speaking.) So for an example from my spreadsheet, eating (only) raw beans will give you 62.5 points per day.  Eating other raw foods in addition to that will make your points per day go down since it lowers the average and bonus.
However, campfire stew on it's own will give you 225 per day."

Unfortunately, there is no use for grass blocks, since dirt roads and ramps can only be crafted using dirt blocks. The result is that grass blocks are piling up in storage. Seems a bit silly. I prefer the way it was in Alpha 4, where grass blocks became dirt blocks when dug up. Players should be able to add grass texture to bare dirt blocks another way. Or, at least add a way to turn grass blocks into dirt blocks."

So far I've enjoyed some of the quality-of-life improvements and new features of Alpha 5. But, with as small a player-base as we have, I only ever encounter 1 or 2 players at a time in a server. And that's problematic when the game relies so heavily on teamwork and specialization. So, to explore the full potential of Alpha 5, let's set a playdate! Imagine what we can accomplish if 5, 10 or even more of us all work together at the same time! My proposal is to set it for this coming Sunday, December 18th. Yes, it's short notice, but I want to get it in before the holidays. We can have more in January! We also need to pick a server. Why not the SLG server? So, who's in?"

I was wondering if any of these suggestions may make it into it. Other AI ""Humans"" who would go off and build, level up, and eat like a normal player, slowly develop an economy as they trade, then build cities, and slowly fall into 1 or 2 different jobs. After eventually creating vehicles, maybe even connecting cities via roads. As the player could choose any roll they pleased, and become a part of this ecosystem, whether he live in a cabin in the woods, or she live in a high-rise apartment. Once becoming developed enough, the AI forming more proper governments, and voting on different laws. Even slowly reproducing and aging, making overpopulation a real threat. Anyways, if you do plan for a Single Player, those would be some very appreciated features, and if not, then maybe consider putting one in?"

On the kick starter page there were stretch goals that went up as far as 700k. Now the kick start produced 200k. However because Strange Loop Games received an award in the amount of almost 900k which brings the total investments to the development of the game to 1.1million does this mean all outlined stretch goals in the kick start will be developed?

What determines the size of the planet?  Can we expect to be able to run a decently sized planet on reasonable hardware, something like a early gen core i7 and 16 gigs of ram?

I used to host a minecraft server for my friend group.  Would have up to 10 or 12 players on at a time with no issues. From what i understand, though, with ECO..  If you are running the world i dont think the number of players is going to have too much processor effect.  Even if a player is nowhere near that group of hares the server still processes their movements and such, still has wolves hunting them, still checks if that plant is comfortable or if pollution is taking its toll..  et cet.  So once you have it running you pretty much have it running.  My bet is that you will run into network limitations first.  Most service providers have a very low upload rate, which is very important for stuff like this. Guess ill see if my old first gen i7 still has the gumption, if that doesnt work perhaps the wifes skylake i5 can handle it."

Does the world size actually affect the perceived curvature of the planet?  I set the server to be 250 by 250.

general,Planet Size | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/970/planet-size,5875,14,10,Kardafly,"It depends on how the game works.  If its actually a sphere then yeah the effect i describe would change with world size.  If they just have a looping grid, which is likely, and use a shader to make the grid seem like a dome that you are always on top of, well then the world size would not inherently alter this effect.  Perhaps it would if they made it change the shader but.. Maybe just for giggles ill generate that 2k by 2k world that Metachronism noted and see if theres a change there.  Might take a while to generate though.  For science!"
general,Planet Size | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/970/planet-size,5875,14,11,darkensign,The world is a flat grid. The curvature is just a graphical effect. There's no reason they can't change the effect depending on world size.

We've had the curvature match the actual world size before.  This has quite a dramatic effect on smaller worlds, but for art-reasons we wanted to stick with a fixed curvature for now.

Also, getting in before the Oct 3rd would be the best, to play around with the current state and to be ready to race out of the gate when the servers get updated with the new version.  (How to build a wall, how to chop down a tree, etc). With the current 4th edition though... it took 3 people in my well communicating group to get to the end research in 10 days, with some of that technology not fully implemented into the game yet, and around 20 days the environment tanked on it's own due to some known balance bugs during the 4th edition time.

There is currently no plan to port this to console that i know of. Though this does not mean that this wont happent .. main goal first of all is to bring it to PC. Then i would guess it depends on how well it will be received by the PC community ( Windows / Mac/ Linux users) So far i have seen there seems to be some interest especially on the xbox one platform for this game. Anyway main focus is PC right now .. then they will look at the possibility for a console port.

general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,1,darkensign,"I'm making this post of how my first few days' experience has been, including frustrations with bugs, new player experience and overall enjoyment of the game thus far. This is intended as feedback for the devs and I'm well aware of the game's alpha status. Many items I mention are quite possibly issues already reported and being worked on, some may be NYI orplaceholders. I'll skip the obvious stuff like placeholder text and icons but I want this to be verbose to ensure I'm not omitting genuine bugs I've simply dismissed as works in progress. Opinions The new player experience is very lacking, that's to be expected in development. I'm hoping to see some introduction to basic keybinds within the client. Tab to unlock cursor & 'e' for ""use"" took a while for me to figure out. I'm no fan of items magically appearing out of nowhere. I enjoy the concept of Eco because everything has a ""system"" behind it. However, when learning early skills, new tools and items appear on my action bar without explanation. I can appreciate how this is necessary given current mechanics, but it'd be nice if there were a requirement to craft them. Please make it so that I can gather seeds from tree branches even after they've fallen. Cedar trees are pretty tricky to strip before being felled and it's honestly a pain to gather enough seeds. How come the ""seed yield"" skill doesn't apply to birch trees, but it does to cedar? As far as I can tell, there is no way to destroy items once created. I'd very much like to rid myself of the excess seeds I've been producing. Currently, the wooden stairs appears in the player's hand as a simple crate and offers no indication which way it'll face when placed. Love the nutrition system, it's pretty engaging trying to watch diet to get the most skill points ASAP. Tying in to that, I love how skill points are scarce enough that one must rely on fellow players to supply goods and services outside their current skill set. It's been fun trading with the wife, my food from my farm in exchange for her building materials. I think this is a big one: Currently, very little happens in the game to engage the player with short term goals. I think that having short term goals that may or may not inhibit the ultimate goal of averting disaster could make for an interesting point of conflict and lend itself to more prolonged game play from players. I think it's telling how there's a flurry of activity after a patch, but weeks later it's difficult to find more than one person playing on any given server. Yes, it's alpha, but the basic premise has been implemented and it doesn't appear to encourage people to stick around for the long game. Given this game's dependence on multiplayer, I'm somewhat concerned about its health if it can't accrue play time even at this early stage. That said, I look forward to the proposed quest system and hope it gives a breath of life to the game and its community. Chests currently have a weight limit and I'm not sure why. Maybe it's a consistency thing t be in line with limits on player backpacks and vehicles but I'm not convinced it's necessary. Bugs Skill trees often fail to display properly. Many inactive skills are only partically drawn or are completely invisible. Sometimes, prerequisite lines are drawn and sometimes that are not. When placing a chest from a stack of two from your action bar, both chests in your action bar are used, but only one chest is placed. The farmers bench is currently a chest - I assume this is placeholder. Water is very buggy, rarely fills adjacent blocks as expected and has lots of display glitches - I assume it's very much WIP. Fire has a graphics bug where crazy artifacts shoot across the screen when looking at it. When viewed from a distance, fire appears to float in the air. Nifty beacon, but probably not the desired effect. The logging speed skill ""reduces the time to fell a tree"". It's actually also very useful for hunting. I simply don't bother with a box: it's much easier to just chase down my prey and one-shot it with my +2 axe. Players backpack weight limit is not enforced when picking up many items. Harvesting plants and collection meat is a notable example as I'm allowed to pick up as much as I like without restriction. Land claim items lack any worldUI. Currently, I work with cues from UI elements tell me when I'min or out of my property and/or simple markers such as clumps of dirt to indicate property boundaries."

A number of these are known bugs, the rest we will fix.  Good to hear your thoughts on the various systems too, especially your point about short term goals. This is something we have a lot of time to experiment with (after Alpha 5, we will be iterating on the existing feature set till release a year out). I think as we flesh out the economy and tech tree and what you're able to do and build it will extend things quite a bit. I'd also like to highlight the current player goals more distinctly (the skills yet to be discovered and the progress of players towards them). Thanks again and hope you have more feedback update."
general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,4,darkensign,"I've been thinking since making the OP and want to expand on a few things. This is pretty much a personal philosophical take on games in general. Consider this post brain food. A simple info screen, possibly when joining a server for the first time and available via escape menu that details the basic controls would be sufficient. Reams of popups for feature after feature a player encounters for the first time are jarring and prevent a player from immersing themselves into the game world. This paragraph hints at a whole host of issues that I haven't really described properly. Many of these issues I don't see being fixed by announced features and some even being exacerbated. I want to be clear here, so forgive me if this comes off a little rambley. By short term goals I mean activities that players can engage actively. @JohnK I noticed you cited the skill system as something that works as a short term goal. It works to an extent but it is ultimately a passive system. Passive systems do not require player action, they ultimately work on a timer. Active systems reward the player for interacting with the game, but the rewards stop when the player stops. The skill system, growing plants and breeding animals and crafting orders are all passive systems. The skill system, during the first play session rapidly grants access to new skills - the player is rewarded for playing actively and can expand his skill set. However, skill acquisition slows to one per several hours and as a result, it becomes another passive system and the player must look for other activities with which to entertain and reward himself. Now, passive reward systems are fine when they accompany active reward systems but it's the active system that Eco ultimately lacks. When actively playing I'm rewarded for running round killing animals for meat, I'm rewarded with resource gathering wood, plants, stone, ore etc. I'm rewarded for building stuff. These things are pretty cool, in my opinion. However, the concept of a virtual lego set is already pretty famous and Eco isn't going to see a large influx of player activity post Minecraft. There's another problem. Currently, I'm punished for playing actively. If I fell too many trees, I'll run out of wood in the long term. If I kill too many animals, there'll be no meat in the future. If I gather too many plants, pretty much everything dies. In many ways, if I play too much, I'm punished. As a result of this,  I'm less likely to be online when my friends come on and want to play with me. There are many reasons why MMOs incorporate repetitive ""grindy"" tasks. Not only do they encourage me to subscribe for longer to achieve goals hidden behind ""kill 1000 monsters"" achievements, they encourage me to be online and available to potentially talk to and group up with online friends. I'm not saying the systems are bad. I think they offer some great long-term challenges. The game just lacks something to pull me in the present rather than the future. There's more to come, but I think I'd best split this into a multi-post."
general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,5,JohnK,"@darkensign said: Agreed on that, I was referring not to the building of skill points but to the acquisition of new skill books, a process which requires skilled players participating across the board harvesting, building, crafting, research, etc.  These are intended to be the 'level ups' for the server, with each subsequent discovery being harder to obtain and requiring more extensive and diverse collaboration, and bringing and connecting all the aspects of the game together. They're the high level goals that everyone will be working towards, and displaying progress and goals more clearly I think will help a lot with what you're describing. @darkensign said: This is another particular challenge we're taking on with Eco, making an online game that does not require grind, but still has a lot of active things you do. The solution we're building towards is the community projects that you engage in: road building and transporting goods, creating and fueling power systems, crafting, building, trading in the economy by buying and selling goods and services (service sales will be key, as its the quest system).  These are all in service of the research aspect, and to level up they'll all need to collaborate.  We want ecosystem impacting things (resource gathering) to not be a source of the grind in the game, as that's something players need to be smart about and limit, so these other aspects will be things we flesh out in greater detail. Participating in the social institutions of the game, the economy and the player run government, will also be major activities. Thanks for the insightful feedback, really appreciate that you get the design challenges we're facing with the game, they're definitely ones I recognize and believe we can find solutions for that will set us apart from the usual grindy stuff you do in games with something much more interesting and collaborative."
general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,6,darkensign,"The justice system. I'm going to be brutally honest: I genuinely believe this will be a waste of your time. I think that when it's implemented and the initial flurry of interest dies down that that vast majority of public servers will simply leave it disabled. The few that use it will be virtual wastelands. It's not nice to say, but I think this system tries to combine key mechanics which simply aren't compatible with each other. I like the basic idea: Turn a magic server-wide field that renders certain animals invulnerable into a mechanic that must be managed and enforced by players. It reinforces the notion that we must work together in order to survive and I love that. So, where's the hate coming from? In a nutshell, it comes from griefing. It's common in games where players are expected to work together. Unfortunately, the hinted ""punishments"" for breaking in-game laws simply aren't going to deter players from aggressively killing everything they see and force the server's player population to play with a handicap or can even effectively kill a server by destroying just about every food source. It is vital that players aren't discouraged from playing with others in a game so dependent on multiplayer cooperation. See my previous post for the reasoning why. Having an open server where players are vulnerable to griefing is quite possibly the best way to ensure no one plays there (except griefers). That said, I like PvP and I think there could well be a way to implement it in a way that encourages players to fight, can offer short term goals, rewards active play and gives players a difficult choice between immediate and long term rewards. I'll just dive right on in with it: Remove the proposed justice system: start with a clean slate. Instead, implement factions. Members of the same faction all agree to follow the laws set out by said faction. Each faction may have its own leader, much like servers can have leaders now. Members of factions do not honour the laws set by other factions. Factions that violate each others laws are effectively at war: Players must fight to ensure their laws are upheld. Of course, going to war means skill points spent on combat skills, resources spent on building weapons and armour instead of more productive/environmentally friendly projects, it means resources not spent on avoiding that meteor impact. War could mean players simply kill each other. It could mean enemy factions do not honour each others' territory claims and can freely destroy each others farms/trees/buildings and rob from enemy chests. I think there's a lot of scope for some meaningful world PvP with this system. Now, there are many things this suggestion doesn't really flesh out, such as inherent problems with asymmetric PvP, different time zones and neutral factions/players not in a faction to name a few. It's what I said in my last post: Brain food."
general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,7,darkensign,I'll admit I have my reservations but this system does sound pretty darn awesome.
general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,8,JohnK,"@darkensign Great points, and I agree griefing is going to be a major concern and something we need to design around.  The nice thing about the justice system as you mentioned is that it gives you conflict, which I like having come from player interactions rather than NPC interactions, and a justice system could do that in a really interesting way.  At best, maintaining justice becomes an additional 'cost' on civilization, but is possible. The naive implementation of law breaking would be a disaster as you say, people would simply come in and kill a world overnight.  But I believe there are more complex methods that can manage that and keep it under control, perhaps there is still a hard limit and you cant chop down every tree overnight, or tear down other's buildings, while still being able to violate the law somewhat.  I think other less invasive law-breaking, like tax evasion or illegal dumping, could be interesting without being a source of griefing.  So it's something I'd like to experiment with while being fully aware of the dangers of griefing. War is another interesting one, because it moves the conflicts between individuals to between organizations. It's also insane from an ecological perspective, and thus a great thing to implement. It also has tons of issues that would need to be sorted out, more than criminal justice I would say, but it is something I would eventually like to do after release sometime. Thanks again!"

I get why we have them, particularly for more advanced equipment but I think they're a bit over demanding at the moment. I don't see a need for any requirements for the earliest stuff, particularly chests. It would be nice if trade counters' requirements were loosened too. Something like requires shelter/roof but not so much interior space or walls. I think it would be a nice option to have open facing shelters will trade counters for a more open plan/trade bazaar sort of feel."
general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,11,Spruce Goose,"Regarding your comments on the justice system. You say the problem is vulnerability to griefing, but the rival factions solution you propose doesn't address that problem at all, it just turns it into a game mechanic. In your example, all griefers would have to do to attack a server is not be a member of the primary server faction. I think the main problem with the current idea of the justice system is unfeasibility of law enforcement. While I understand John's desire to keep the game focused on player interaction, most servers simply don't and won't have the manpower to effectively enforce their laws. You have to assume each player only has a few hours per day to play the game, and even though the world of Eco is small, each player only occupies a small fraction of that world while they are playing. On top of that, most players will not actively be looking for law violations. The simple truth is that a griefer can log into the server at 4 AM and shoot all the wolves in the world dead while everyone is asleep. There needs to be a way for law enforcement to be effective even with sparse player population, and that simply can't rely on player enforcement alone. The feature will be disabled on almost all servers if it doesn't work. The most obvious solution in my opinion is the inclusion of NPC guards that can patrol certain areas as determined by the player government or leader. (maybe make the first few free and require upkeep for larger forces) These guards would not replace PVP law enforcement, but supplement it so that people can sleep easier at night knowing their server will not be on fire or a complete barren desert when they wake up. At higher tech levels, the players may be able to build security cameras or other systems that alert guards to crimes. Also, don't get me wrong. I like the idea of separate facitons being able to enforce different laws on different parts of the world, and maybe different laws applying to players in certain areas based on their faction membership, but that feature would not be a solution to the justice system problem."
general,Feedback so far | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/891/feedback-so-far,3858,12,12,darkensign,"@Spruce-Goose said: The point of that paragraph was to confer a basic concept, not cover details and potential pitfalls. The issue you mentioned is solved by having faction-less players follow ALL laws of all factions. Where two different laws clash, the more strict of the two laws is enforced. It's not realistic, but it does prevent griefing. Exactly. There's also the issue of carebearism - where players won't engage in PvP regardless of any advantage. Interesting concept."

When the game starts, the numbers are unsustainable given reproduction and consumption rates.

general,Honest Opinions... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/835/honest-opinions,2895,6,1,Halleyelec,"Hi guys, I have been following ECO for some time now and wishing it would come out on Steam quicker...but I am not that patient and REALLY want to play it. Question I have is whether it is actually worth $40.00 / £30.00 at the moment? I can appreciate that the game, like all beta /alpha games are constantly evolving but I don't (I lie, I fear my wife will cut my testicles off) if I purchase it, regret the decision and never play it again. Your honest opinions would be greatly appreciated!"
general,Honest Opinions... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/835/honest-opinions,2895,6,2,NoBlackThunder,"Well .. honest opinion on my side.. well it depends. The way i buy game it is worth, i see my self as an investor and therefore i can pay a higher price like the current price. But of course the game is still in a very early stage and i fear that people might by and think ""well that's not what i expected"" and never play it again. That is also the reason why this game is not on steam yet. Lots of stuff in missing, not working as intended and allot of bugs every where, its basically still in a very early stage. But from beta 3 to 4 it is slowly starting to form in to a game that is slowly and steady getting closer to the goal for the masses. So the above is more why not to buy it right now, so why would people buy it right now ? Well its because you are sort of an investor, its always risky but you can help to develop the game with your founds, your feedback and you show how much interest is in this kind of a game. Every current backer is here to help shaping the future of this game! John the ceo really has his heart in this and loves every idea and feedback. I know he would love have even more feedback, and he values every single feedback and ideas he gets from the community! So it really depends on you, what you wish and what you think! There are many upsides and downsides. The downside is that this is still an early game and you might not get right away what you wish for since its still in heavy development with many core systems far from finished. On the other side every one can contribute help to shape this game with there feedback, helping on the wiki. People can start making mods with very good support from the devs them selv. Or with a higher tier like the dev tier people can even help make the game buy coding and bug fixing the source code it self (and that is VERY unusual to be able to do and even have access to it on a commercial game) So at this state its hard do answer your question if you think if its worth, that really depends on the view of each person. In my eyes it is , because i can be part of something great, and help to make it great!  and that alone is worth the 175$ i payed on kickstarter. The same way i see it was worth backing star citizen with 800$ over the years to give people a chance and help to try to make something special and great, even though there is always a chance it could backfire ( star citizen can still backfire if you believe all the trolls that complain about they dont have founds to keep on making that game and will run away with all backer money, something i still feel is total garbage). I hope that answers your question."
general,Honest Opinions... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/835/honest-opinions,2895,6,3,NoBlackThunder,"(disclaimer i might remember john statement below wrong) Also i remember a thing john said on why the game is so high price right now (compared to other games that start out very cheap and go higher while this game will go down in price later when it is closing to release) if i remember right he said that he does not want the big masses that buy the game, complain about it state and then instantly request a refund (like the internet people are always doing) He really just wants active people right now helping supporting the game, refunds take allot of time away from the development, so the high price is both to scare away people and you are giving the little extra to help, and show your interest and you believe in his idea. I also know that for right now he has founding until next year from US education system because they also like the idea of this game ( i think they got around 800 000 $ (and that's allot of money))

general,Honest Opinions... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/835/honest-opinions,2895,6,4,jhadred,"Can't say much more than what's already been said.  It really is going to depend on your reason for wanting to buy into an alpha (or beta) game.  Are you investing into the direction of the game as described earlier, or do you want to just play because it looks interesting? If you are looking at investing because you like the concept and want to help out, I say go for it.  Help break things, give suggestions and proofread code.  I waited until just before alpha 4 to make my investment.  I liked where the game was headed (and is heading) and the plan for where it's going (plans so that players have a larger impact to the game environment) and that there was the US grant money helped my decision making as an investment rather than as a current game.   I don't have dev tier access at this time, but one of my teammates does so we've discussed what we've found in code to decide if something is a bug or just hasn't been defined yet. If you are in just for the sake of playing, then you may wish to wait.  As mentioned, it's in heavy development with core systems still being worked on.  In regards to game length, 3 people as a close team is able to get to the current endgame within 7-10 days in alpha 4.2, which includes some delays due to bugs.  Speaking of, there could also be bugs that really impact the game from being played. We had a plant growth issue with 4.2 that had to be hotfixed but still leaves some annoying impact on game servers where there wasn't a full server reset.  Plus with the frequency of major updates, which is a good thing as it does mean active work, this means with major releases, the world is reset.  This means deleting the world and all the work that the players had done and creating a new one so that players start from scratch.   Things like the bug or the server resets would be enough to cause negative reviews and refund requests if the game was for the masses.  Large scale negative or even mixed reviews can have a significant impact on a game's sales. There are also people who invest early on and simply don't play it for a while.  I've seen a few people join the server and say that they haven't tried since earlier in the alpha and wanted to see what it was like currently with the changes from X version. ...so... it depends.

If they don't deliver, they would be in serious hot water with the US federal government, so it's pretty safe to say SLG is serious about the game!  Even if you buy it now and are unsatisfied, you could leave it alone and come back in a few months when it's more complete."

I am sure that given I am fortunate enough to be able to have an hour or two a day to play any sort of game, I could see myself getting more involved with discussions and feedback...who knows...

general,Depth of digging? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/770/depth-of-digging,7260,12,9,Metachronism,"Generation is using a series of noise functions which generate values generally in the range of [-1, 1].  It isn't exactly like minecraft where everything is generated off one seed value - each different noise function can have its own, and they are all chained together to get the end result (the seed value in the config just uses that seed to generate each other noise functions seed). So inside the terrain generator config you will see various biomes and block generation parameters for the various block types.  Eg, make an Iron block if the noise value is between [.2, .25] for example.  If you were to increase this range, you'd likely have more iron.  Each range can either be a specific block type or a new sub-group of a different collection of block types (a ""biome"")."

height ranges from [-1, 0] mapping heights 0 to sea level; [0, 1] going from sea level to maximum worldgen height. For example, sand is always generated at the height range of 0.  Grass is generated with in a noise range, but only at a depth of 0 (the surface).  Forested areas have a height range of [.1, 1] so you wont currently see a forest at lower elevations right now."

It seems like intel hd4000 gpu's are standard for mac computers. even though its a great gpu and a cheap one for desktop stuff its one of the worst gpu's for playing games out there. it works and the game will start, But when it comes to performance i cant promise you it will be with a high framerate, that of course applies for the current game state from what i have read. There is always done some optimization in the code, but i think the most optimization wil be done towards the end of the development when game systems become more done and complete. Therfore it is not easy to give any final system requirements yet for the game. We could say it works on X hardware fine . but in 5 month it might not . and then in the release version it might maybe work again. That all said and personal options aside: I know there are mac users with mac that rund the plain old HD4000 and HD5000 GPU's and say it works fine while i also know there are other mac users that say its unplayable because of the low framerate (do to the lack of hardware power). I suspect that a lower end cpu might be the reason for that though in the end. So depending on what hardware your mac has, but there cant be given any guarantee. What you can do is buy the game and try it out. if its not working well for you you can send a refund request to support@strangeloopgames.com , i would appreciate if you do that that you keep me postet on how well the game works so i can help later other mac users when they ask the same questions =)"

general,Using rock as walls | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/781/using-rock-as-walls,1005,2,2,Nappelinis,"Hey @Bananen
You should be able to use stone/rock as walls. Wood roof. Just make sure room requirements are met by hovering over the table within.
Most starting tables require 10 logs to be included in the structure and there to be 10 open spaces. Down down view:
S = stone/soil/logs (pretty much whatever)
D = door slot (to walk through)
o = free slot SSSSS
SoooS
SoooS
SoooS
SSDSS 9 Open slots, the door slot counts as the 10th required open space.
10 blocks of the buildign need to be logs, if your roof above the 'o' and 'D' are logs you should be fine."

general,How does the grid system work? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/775/how-does-the-grid-system-work,4513,11,1,urb4n0ninj4,"I've been fascinated by how this game works since I got it. I play games that use grid-based building a lot, and all of them handle worlds as flat, endless worlds (minecraft, 7 days to die, etc) or the worlds are so large that they can use square grids within them (Space Engineers). But this game...This is different. Now, if you project a grid onto a sphere you get a lot of issues normally. For example, bunching at poles, or distortion on Z-axes.
I'm super curious how the latter problem is handled.
I'm not a programmer, or a game designer by any stretch of the imagination. It seems to me to make a grid on a sphere you'd have to project evenly spaced lines out from the center (as z-axes) but then you'd run into a huge issue that at different elevations, blocks would be different sizes. I imagine the issue isn't a big deal as planets get larger and the difference between sizes at different elevations gets smaller, but for small planets this seems like a huge hurdle.  Of course, if it's a trade secret how it is done, all well and good. Hopefully I've opened the eyes of some people who might not recognize what a technically daunting concept this seems...at least to a development moron like me :P"
general,How does the grid system work? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/775/how-does-the-grid-system-work,4513,11,2,Xelotath,"I believe the trick they use is that the world is actually flat (thus each voxel is a perfect cube) and when you run to the end of the +x dimension, you wrap over to x=0.  (This is why there are certain discontinuities, like carts having trouble passing the boundary.)  The curvature of the planet would then be just an illusion, a purely visual distortion of the voxels on the horizon.  The minimap might be a different story, I haven't really given thought to how they do that."

When seeing all the mechanics of the game, I started having the ""too good to be true"" syndrome, like all of this wouldn't be able to work together so I wanted to know from players' experience how it's working so far. For example the economy, like the economy is supposed to work on the supply/demand mechanic but is it working? Is there some mechanics that are more chosen by players because they are more rewarding? Or for the environment (I'm not sure if this is implemented yet) is it really working like it should and are the players action influencing enough, or too much?
In short are there mechanics that just don't work well together. I know those are very vague questions but I really hope the game will work, I've already been interested in some other games with mechanics that also sounded too good to be true and unfortuntely it turned out to be the case. Anyway keep up the good work strangeloop because I really want this game to work :D"

With the people I've seen so far, they're new and trying things out so don't really go into bartering.  But we do give them some free things to help out.  Some have helped out with their labor, some joined and helped by taking skills.    Someone had a forum post about economy and trying to work this process using stores vs sharing, so it's really up to how all the players want.   Money doesn't exist (or at least doesn't in the early activity for a player).   While I used to give away some of the lesser foodcrafts, I eventually set up a store which I set up some trades so that someone who wanted food x, would  drop off the amount of raw ingredients it would take me to make that food x.  This way, anyone in the world could do it, not just the people I was working with in a shared capacity.    I don't know how something like that would work in later game points.  As an exaggeration, how do you decide what a computer is worth if the player only has meat and potatoes to give."

general,The game so far? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/745/the-game-so-far,2047,5,4,jhadred,"I see, I think.
Yes, some game mechanics have yet to be implemented. While there is some pollution (making metal makes scrap tailings that have no use and are garbage and this can pollute the ground), more is planned as per the link.  I believe the same thing for electricity.  Power is there in terms of burning wood and coal for campfires, stoves and smelting ore, but there seems to be more planned. Mechanics in terms of skills:  I don't know much about late game skills due a loss of a saved session that had to restart (nuclear physics, electronics), the early game skills most of the skills are needed in order to advance.  People put points into basic survival skills (chopping trees to get wood, digging dirt/moving broken stone, breaking stone & ore). From there, in a group who shares everything, people split up because all of the skills are needed and at that point, one person cannot get all of those skills efficiently.  Smelting, Masonry, Agriculture and Cooking.  There are some areas within those that are currently ""less valued""  but this may change and I may be wrong about them due to not knowing the late game skills.   For example, glassmaking (within Masonry) does not yet have a major use that I was able to see.  However, I'd say that most skills are equally critical to get ingots from smelting ore, bricks from masonry, cooked food for better skill points and making doing actions, and being able to make those crops & seeds so people can cook food.  bricks and iron are needed to make a stove and kitchen for the cook, and all of it is needed to unlock other skills.   Even guessing, agriculture helps to get the plants needed for biofuel later on. I think I know what you mean. Like in some mmorpgs, taking points and having to train in Archery, fletching (arrowmaking), alchemy and cooking (where food is not necessary) is kind of pointless because it didn't do much and was harder to train than other skills which did more damage or had more effect in helping other people.  The most I was able to make was pies that healed people or gave mp and in terms of healing, a spellcaster was better for it.  I still took it, one of the few who did in that game.  It wasn't until a later update that those skills became needed to make special items or dyed items to change it's color.  (Yes, I know this sounds like a manga or book storyline but I'm obviously not the only person that took useless skills that required more work.  I did this in a Microsoft game in 1999 and at that point, people were laughing about why I was running from cows, which gave me trouble to take them down, but still needed them for meat.  Despite that I still take those skills in any game I'm able to).    I'd say that so far, this game isn't like that."

Tree seeds will now sometimes drop from cut logs if your logging skill is high enough.
You can now craft new axes at a builder’s hut.
Cooking skill now attainable at any campfire.
Kitchen added. You can make better meat-based foods here.
Baking Skill book now attainable at the mill.
Bakery added. You can make better grain-based foods here.
Added waste management building. Turns items into larger stacks of garbage at the cost of minor pollution.
Shoveled dirt will be added to your inventory. This will likely change in the future with transport, but for now we’ve enabled it.
You can now build dirt and stone roads at the town hall. Both of these will give varying movement speed benefits. The art is not final for these.
/reopen when you are standing in an owned building will put it back in construction, letting you make modifications to the building. This feature will be integrated properly (not through commands) in the future. Improvements Logging now gives wood proportional to your logging skill.
Log roofs may be removed with axe, not just hammer.
Buildings should prevent deconstruction correctly now.
Town hall creation requirement reduced.
Added /help for chat commands.
Added /players to get a list of online players.
You can no longer eat craft table fees.
/unstuck now places you at the highest block position, doesn’t just Icarian Flight you.
Storage House is now a larger building, but gives a “big chest”.
Added an automatic backup plugin to the server.
Re-ordered tech tree to make prepared meat more useful.
New items no longer are placed in the first available empty spot.
Vastly improved server startup time. Should be at or around 15 seconds (depending on CPU specs and excluding any load time.)
Numbers on toolbar and mouse-wheel to scroll through items added.
Did a pass on max stack sizes for all items.
Law page: edit and remove graphs.
Law page: URL and port are both relative to the server’s domain.
You no longer need to run the server as admin for laws to work.
Added time of day scaling. This value can control the length that the day/night cycle lasts, but doesn't otherwise affect the time scale of the game.
Added option to seed the world generation off a base seed, instead of needing to set seeds of each individual module. Bug Fixes Mouse lock fixed for users playing in fullscreen with multiple monitors.
Issues with construction sites such as “This site is not yours” have been resolved.
Server crash fixed when picking up and placing world objects quickly.
Fixed issue with laser beam always showing when building laser.
Fixed issue with mod kit compiler failing to write to temp directory.
When abandoning a construction site, your current location currently updates.
Skill scrolls actually consume themselves on use.
Occasional mismatch between held object vs selected object resolved.
Fixed bug with middle-mouse dragging icons.
Skill scroll crafting no longer duplicates skill books.

However, when I go near player areas and buildings after a few minutes it begins to get slower and slower, becomes a cumulative lag, ie I start to freeze for longer and longer periods.
From a dev point, I think this is interesting as I can clearly walk around these areas at the start, but after 10 minutes....game is unplayable and crashes. Really like the town setups you have so far, long term super keen to see how this game promotes teamwork.

I know Microsoft has Visual studio Code available for mac. you should check it out and see if you can work with winforms app in it. then the other question is if Unity supports building apps with dll files on mach ( though i think that is very likely ) so if you can do that then you should be able."

The game seems rather dead from what I have been reading, not many people play anymore? And the people that do play are ""trolls"" or just toxic. I don't have much money, so I always try to get as much information as I can before I buy a game. It seems really awesome in concept, but what are the pros and cons? I really would like to enjoy this game, I know if I get it and show it to my wife and the rest of my family, I'm 100% sure we'll all play, we love survival games, especially ones where we have to work together."
general,Considering buying | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/568/considering-buying,2009,4,2,NoBlackThunder,"Hey. Yes there are not many people playing right now, there are many factors for that , First of all because its a very ( very very very , like a prototype almost) version of the game. almost no system is done. Many things are still missing from the game, and it basically takes just one week to get to the end ( current end is meteor strike, but that end will change somewhat if i am not wrong)  Meaning that there is not allot to keep playing people this for very long right now. i am sure there will be allot of people playing when alpha 4 comes out that has allot of changes. Yes the price is high, you help to support the development of the game and get a very early peak at it, everyone can also contribute to the game ( Dev tier backers can submit code, and others can give feedback and do even mods and other stuff that does not require source code access) I have only seen one report of trolls/ hackers/persons that exploits bugs, so fa. So it seems when the server are active people tend to behave and community server do a good job in handling everything and keep trolls out. Well that said, if you are unsure and don't have allot of money i recommend you to wait and keep an eye on this for now =). and maybe even spread the word about this game ( so you have more people to play with ;) ) hope that helps you for now Florian"

general,Question for those on developer or higher tier | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/434/question-for-those-on-developer-or-higher-tier,1198,2,1,Menaan,"Hello,
A friend linked me this game today and I think the idea of it is great.  I noticed that there is a developer tier purchase option which says ""Ability to submit changes for possible integration. Direct connection with the team and ability to chat with them and share task planning.""  So I'm wondering how this works out in actuality.  Do they ever really take code changes from those in the developer tier or include them in discussions?  Or is it just a ploy to get those interested in such things to spend more money as some other productions have done previously. I ask because I'm a developer myself, a pretty good one actually (I know that sounds boastful but it's simply true).  I've been looking for a descent hobby project that interests me to spend a few hours here and there working on.  I have no doubts I could make great contributions to any project I worked on, however I don't want to invest time in something to run into a wall with the types of developers that don't like to get help from outside.  I've ran into those kinds before on a previous game that I will not name here.  I spent about 30 hours refining and vastly improving their server client communications, only for them to never actually include it in their code.  One response I finally got from them on it even specifically said they weren't really interested in having other people's code in their project that they only used it to get ideas for writing their own code.  That was rather annoying to have put effort in to make real improvements to their game for free, for them to turn their noses up at it. So, if this game is like that as well and the developers aren't really interested in outside help, that is fine.  I will probably still consider getting a basic tier access because I do like the concept. Thanks, Menaan"

Our plans are to do like you say, have lots of things you can add to a building beyond a single crafting table, so you can have multiple purposes to a building.  We'll be able to do this as we start to flesh out the content of the game. On the other hand, we want there to be a need to build, thus putting demand on resources and space and requiring transport and additional energy.  By the end of the game, a huge chunk of the world will need to be covered in buildings for you to win the game.  If you can cram all the stuff you need in a single building there's no need for most of the interesting systems of the game (and its also unrealistic, you have many different kinds of buildings in the real world).  I think we're on the same page as far as that goes, and definitely agree buildings need to have more purpose.

I can only imagine the occasional scratch to the head that a player might have over the fact that any decently populated server will probably have 50-100 buildings on it from every player wanting to have their own basic generation buildings on top of the normal industrial side of things. This being said, I'm still expecting all major industrial buildings to be their own separate building, I mean that or logically connect them. The Mine and the Refinery should be either buildings together or functioned in such a way that I can build my Mine and then connect to it a refinery, or maybe snap in the main refinery component and have it function properly. I'm just trying my best to give honest feedback that still holds true to how real world humanity would process an event like this. Why build 10 buildings when I can make like buildings function together in the same location?

bonus for size. This way we might be able to see mega factory / mega power plants. I'm think size should increase production speed but maybe. Material requirement should be material  or better.  This way if I want to build a stone house I can. Allow for two doors/ double doors. over-sized doors, windows, etc. I think this is difficult right now because there is no minimum block count, there is only minimum block of a specific type. If the minimum block count was more in line with the minimum volume this would just mean that if you want to have a very ""airy"" building you would need to make it larger/taller."

If we think about the actual space required to make an effective woodworking workshop for example, the walls are lined with tools and what not.  And usually, a woodworking shed would be much bigger than the maybe nine foot wide room we actually need for a woodworking shop in game.  I think the idea is that while we interact with the saw within the room, the entire room is being utilized.  In this vein, I'd like to see bonuses being given to production when making rooms bigger than they have to be. One of the quickest thing lost in games is the realization of space and distance.  Things like infinite inventories and automagically teleporting market boards push convenience in the face of the player.  Convenient gameplay is a real quick way to strip what would have been a meaningful choice from the hands of the player, and from what I've experienced, Eco is all about choices.  Limiting that inventory will make the player think twice about what they carry with them.  Forcing players to walk will make them think twice about whether the trip will be worth it.  And forcing them to need a building that is large will make them think twice about building in one spot or another. Convenient gameplay should never trump meaningful gameplay, in my opinion.  One of the first things I learned about game design was to enjoy being sadistic."

Limited inventory means you need to build transport networks, not make 50 trips (though people will do that just to brute force it, which we'll need to prevent somehow, calorie burn maybe)."

For instance, having a server clock that tracks real world time seems like a good idea, until you realise a substantial proportion of your players already live in a real world with jobs and stuff,  and thus their real-life-daylight-hours and in-game-daylight-hours compete, leaving you with only being able to participate in one reality during evening / darkness times. And obviously, the threat of human destruction to an asteroid is measured in like, thousands to millions of years, and it would be impractical to map to such a ridiculous time scale at 1:1 So you very much need some super-normal game-play elements just to make the game viable as a game. If you accelerated the milllion-year timescale to a week, peoples movements being scaled in proportion would be such a blur the game would be unplayable. So you have to proxy the effect by generalising it, say, having an unrealistic carry capacity to approximate the effect of being able to communicate a weeks worth of effort in an hour without needing to be constantly sprinting between A and B."

The first games, that were postet were Eco, Fortresscraft Evolved and Infinifactory. The latter he already made a video of and so chat ruled for Eco.

I had 3-4 tailings in a raw stone silo that seemed to work well until I put more than 5 in it and then the entire surrounding area became polluted. =( I am going to try again with regular stone to see if that works. I have also dug out the area around the silo to make about 2 empty blocks between the silo and any surrounding dirt. Anyone else have ideas or things that are working for them? Ii will post pictures when I get a chance.

general,Containing Tailings? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/362/containing-tailings,3575,5,5,paintedwolff,From my preliminary testing it does not need to be closed on top just away from soil/water with a barrier of stone or distance.

Not a single piece of gold which I need 5 of to tech up. Some resoure balancing is needed, and a stronger tech tree which I assume is in the works. In the meantime can we get some information on the rarity and spawn rates/locations of various materials? Also is there a way to repair the damage to the environment from tress?

Pros
Cons First Impressions Review... Thoughts:
It only takes minutes from turning a game on to know if your going to like it or not and with this game I think it's got potential. I enjoyed my first couple of days playing with friends, there were a few bugs/glitches but nothing major that made it unplayable... Pros:
I like the crafting table layout, simple to understand and simple to use, i like setting fees for others to use it, I like the visuals of the game, I like the books which unlock extra buildings Cons:
I don't like building a separate building for each type of room, I want to just build it freely myself from which ever materials I choose, not be restricted to a certain material,
I don't like having to wait lengthy times for items to craft (although this may improve later in alpha/beta when there are other things to keep you busy.
I want to see what's in other players hands, I want to have a player list so I can see who's in the server (this would normally be done with TAB), animals glitching around the place makes it hard for hunting them but again this will be fixed later It's a good effort so far, definitely has potential to be a winner, looking forward to future updates."

I know saplings are still in development to replant and such, but I was curious... what if when the saplings come out and we start to replant, that all of a sudden it attracts new wildlife or ""spawns"" them? What my idea suggests is the more ""green"" or sustainable an area is, the more life there is and therefore, possibly, a faster growth rate for trees, plants, and animals? And opposite for the less there is? Sort of like a bonus for how green you keep your area. Not sure if this will be already implemented or not, but just an idea? The only issue with it is people building it close to home for the sake of killing or harvesting out of convenience, so quite possibly make a rule in the code somewhere it has to be x amount of distance from any constructed buildings or mines of any sort?"

So you can have like a new forest each day. Tree seeds are set to 0.1 drop chance by default if that is why you dont get them. And you can make it so trees drop say 10 instead of 5 to make it easier.

Are there thoughts to identifying the game as 'Play Eco' or 'Eco Online' or maybe something like 'Eco-World' to make it pop a little more as a game/tool?

Depends on the building requirements. Perhaps the req. for the buildings can be tweaked in the future. Instead of a building, you just need a corner or a small wooden floor and walls to place your bench at.

general,ECO LAUNCH TIME | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/108/eco-launch-time,26964,47,5,NoBlackThunder,"lots of critical bugs have been closed the last few days but there are still 7 left on github marked for alpha and many more for beta .. right now they are asleep since its like 4 am where the devs are living .. john wants to get the game out asap .. last time when he open up for dev tier he pulled the trigger and before the posted time, since he really loves to get feedback and get the game out as soon as possible .. so there is a high change of an release within 6 hours or more"

I would be so excited getting ready for launch day. Yes it means an onslaught of additional feedback and bugs - but wouldn't you be so amped to give your baby life?
general,ECO LAUNCH TIME | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/108/eco-launch-time,26964,47,10,Firestar000,@pyhfol I 100% agree!  HOW CAN YOU SLEEP AT A TIME LIKE THIS?
general,ECO LAUNCH TIME | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/108/eco-launch-time,26964,47,11,NaturesAdvocate,"We are waiting in line like at a Star Wars Opening day or any other album release. PS4 on black friday, door buster. Oh wait we already paid but are still waiting. :P We have no pull to ask the devs to pull an all nighter or an all weeker to give us what we want at a specific time. Though I do agree 100%    that   00:00= Zero Hour is always the best policy."

general,ECO LAUNCH TIME | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/108/eco-launch-time,26964,47,13,Guest,I've been waiting all night ... I think you could tell the time of launch

I think John said the tiers will change once Alpha is launched.

Yea prices will go up after alpha and maybe that will be removed.
but we can ask him to be sure =) @JohnK"
