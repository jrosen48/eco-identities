eco-as-education,Eco as a Norwegian Environmental Education Tool | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1056/eco-as-a-norwegian-environmental-education-tool,3308,7,1,Motsaenggin,"Hello all, I am a PhD candidate in Environmental Psychology and Communication at the Department of Psychology at the Norwegian University of Science and Education, stationed in Trondheim, Norway. My PhD revolves around the use of games (digital and board-based) in environmental communication, and I am one of the recent patrons to have purchased the Classroom Pack for Eco. I am currently enrolled in creating a psychological framework model directed towards finding that elusive balance between a good game and an educational tool (which, as it turns out, is incredibly hard indeed! I am hoping to form a strong network here where I can observe, communicate and share ideas with like-minded and not-so-like-minded people, and I suppose this thread serves as a general introduction for myself and my work. It is intriguing to see so many people gather around Eco as a tool for education, and I hope to see the game flourish by the time it is released to the more mainstream gaming audience on Steam and similar gaming platforms. Feel free to introduce yourselves here if you will, and do let me know if there are other psychologists / researchers out there working around similar themes!"

My education was Bsc Applied Ecology and Postgrad in Sustainable Development. The reason I mention my education is solely to show some background on the Eco game. I have spent considerable time looking at the benefits of gaming.  My experience with educators is that they see games as a thing young people do.  I often get strange looks when I explain I 'game'.  Pupils love this however and I find it a gateway in helping me get concepts across. They do not see them as a tool for educating.  This is were Eco can make a massive difference. I hope to contribute has much as can in helping us all make this game great for players, pupils and educators. Regards

eco-as-education,The Potential of educational games | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5102/the-potential-of-educational-games,264,1,1,schmudo1,"Hi! For a semester work, I wanted to analyze the potential of games as educational assets. For this I wanted to compare serious games with entertaining games. It is easy to say: Call of Duty Black Ops 4 is way more interesting than a game about sustainable food sources. But what can a game like that do, to be more interesting? You guys are working on a monumental project that tries to implement the impact humans can have on the planet in a minecraftesque type of game. Not only is it entertaining (we all know what kind of success these kind of games can have) but also educational. Experiencing the consequences ""yourself"" what it means if you burn down all the forests has a stronger learning effect on a person than only hearing about it from school or news. So I was wondering if you could maybe fill out a small interview on this topic, to help me write a guidebook on how to make serious games more interesting for young people. This guide might be used to develop a game on sustainability for various schools in Zürich. I did not find any kind of contact email adress, so I post this in the public forum hoping a moderator could help me. If you are interested in answering my 7 Question interview, that would be amazing!"

I'm in charge of the media subjects and IT.  One of my passions is making games more accepted by educators on the whole.  I find most educators stuck in this motion that games are bad.  Using the right approach games are actually incredibly beneficial. Once the game is more stable I'm going to start looking at how this can be implemented into the school teaching.  I currently use Minecraft as a tool but feel this game as more scope.  I'm keen to hear from the devs or people working on mods.  My plan is to use the game as part of a long term project for the pupils.  By incorporating real skills like planning, discussions and implementation the game could really shine as a education tool.

eco-as-education,Specific Biome - grasslands | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4506/specific-biome-grasslands,470,1,1,TIngels777,"Hello
My son is a 5th grader and wants to simulate cause/effect of depleting water supplies and other natural resources in a grasslands biome.  My question for this thread is, does the ECO game allow for such a specific task, or would you have to more globally deplete resources in this game to see results?  It seems like the game is compilation of several biomes, but that is just from reading discussions as we haven't bought it yet. Any thoughts would be appreciated and thanks for reading!

eco-as-education,Eco for Elementary-Age Students | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/364/eco-for-elementary-age-students,5417,10,1,hypnagogic,"I teach with K-5th graders.  There is so much interest in Minecraft among these young students.  And our 3rd grade has a prominent unit on interdependency and ecosystems.  This game would be a huge hit with these young gamers.  I worry that the economy and certain other elements of the game might be a bit overwhelming at first.  But I can also see how this game could be used in different ways at different grade levels (e.g. 3rd grade focuses on interdependence of elements in an ecosystem, fourth graders focus on interpreting graphs and charts, fifth graders look at mod development), so the opportunity to buy a license and gift it to the child is enticing. I am hopeful that I, as the teacher, can mod the game into a more simple form.  Perhaps remove entire elements from the game (e.g. economy) to make it more digestible and streamlined.  I am curious if there are other educators out there who are thinking along the same lines I am.  I am curious if the developers have given much thought to making the game playable for younger kids.   I would love to connect with a  couple other people in the Eco community to share ideas and problems as we think about bringing this game to elementary education."
eco-as-education,Eco for Elementary-Age Students | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/364/eco-for-elementary-age-students,5417,10,2,dannypent,"Hello @hypnagogic, I work with K-8th graders during the summer months on subjects ranging from web development and video game creation to mathematics. I'm hoping to try and develop a curriculum for Eco over the next few months as development continues and more features are added/improved within the game. To address your concern over the current state of the game (excluding the bugs and clunkiness of controls) and its economy specifically, I believe it is already geared towards younger gamers. Given the fact that students are now (in vast majority) exposed to a plethora of electronic devices and gaming content at young ages, I believe that quick tutorials would be ample enough to get them going. Currently, I and another developer are beginning talks with an instructor from Canada who is going to be test-driving Eco in there classroom shortly. We've offered to host a server for them to experiment with how students interact in the game and to learn about different gameplay mechanics they feel are too difficult or are needed. If you'd be interested in doing something similar to this in the future as a way to try it out in an academic setting without risking interactions with others outside of your classroom on public servers, we would be happy to try and set something up."
eco-as-education,Eco for Elementary-Age Students | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/364/eco-for-elementary-age-students,5417,10,3,hypnagogic,"What a fantastic offer!  We haven't purchased the classroom license yet.  I am testing the game now to see whether we want to make the purchase or not.  I believe that you are correct about younger students being able to digest the complexities of the game.  I know that they crave complexity in gaming.  However, it would be good to be able to disable certain features and make a leaner version of the game.  This works well while they are learning the game.  It also works well for teachers who may not be proficient gamers and would benefit from a leaner game, or who would really like the students to focus on one or two key elements, as they relate to the classroom topics. After I audition the game, and we make a decision about whether to purchase a school license or not, I will let you know if we can use that server you offered.  Thanks again!  I look forward to hearing more about your experiences using this game with young students."

I would love to get a repository of curriculum and mods that teachers can use to customize Eco to fit their classroom, and the goal is that by our official 'release' in 2017 we will have a really simple way for teachers to set this up for their class and customize it to their liking, removing all the rough edges for both students and teachers.  So you definitely have our full support in any mods and curriculum you want to start prototyping, and we can help with that development as well.  Let us know your thoughts as you work on ways this game could be used in education."

I have been following the development of this game and watching your videos.  I appreciate your input in this discussion. John, can you speak to the notion of modding as a ""subtractive process""?  I have a notion of mods as an additive.  Is it comparable to use a mod to remove or pare down a game?"
eco-as-education,Eco for Elementary-Age Students | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/364/eco-for-elementary-age-students,5417,10,6,JohnK,"Not currently, but I like the idea and it could be something we add. It could either be done through server properties, or special mods that 'block' other mods. It already exists for some features, ie you can turn off the meteor via server properties, or change/disable the ecosystem, etc.  Pretty easy to put switches on things to turn them off, and I want to make it easy to do via a web interface.  Perhaps we can have predefined packages of the game for different ages. Curious to hear more @hypnagogic about how you think the game could change for younger students, and @dannypent what kind of curriculum you're thinking of building.  We're hoping to have an official package of curriculum to go with the game by launch in 2017, perhaps this is something you'd like to work with us on?"
eco-as-education,Eco for Elementary-Age Students | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/364/eco-for-elementary-age-students,5417,10,7,hypnagogic,"Thanks for your considered response, @JohnK We have a third grade unit on interdependency and ecosystems.  How animals thrive and adapt in particular environments and the food chain.  They also learn the different biomes. I think students could work in small groups to manage their world, the resources and the wildlife.  They could experience in a first-hand way, how overuse results in a spoiled ecosystem.  By devising the rules that they need to make their world thrive, they confront the necessary steps to protect an ecosystem.  This could lead to very thoughtful conversations about our world and how we can do a better job of managing our resources. I would love to see a robust variety of biomes.  Being able to add biomes (via mods) would be awesome.  Currently our students design animals to suit a particular biome (using arts and craft supplies).  We toyed with the idea of letting them design a biome, but abandoned it as too intellectual for them to really engage.  However, in the realm of this simulated world, designing a biome could be a fun challenge.  Given these organisms, can you devise an ideal biome for them to thrive. The underlying architecture of Eco could also be used to create simulations without human involvement.  You design a biome.  You design the organisms.  You push go and watch how the ecosystem thrives or fails.  Edit the settings and let it go again.  Did it survive longer this time? I have mocked up similar computer simulations and let the kids play with birth rates and life expectancies of animals in their eco system.  They can see why apex predators need to have low birth rates, and feeder animals (herbivores) need to have high birth rate.  If one species in your eco system goes extinct, then the eco system has collapsed and you need to start over again.  Seeing how long (time) the ecosystem survives becomes an indicator of how well-balanced it is. These are some thoughts from the top of my head, but I am pleased to be conversing with you, John, about this and I'm looking forward to more in-depth conversations to come."

We're hoping to make Eco a platform open enough that it can support all kinds of mods like that, and grow into some very different systems.  Will have to keep in touch as we start fleshing out these systems more and getting to the point where we can have that capability.  Great curriculum ideas there."

I am an educator and really want to use Eco but can not see how this would work given my limited amount of the time with the students. 15-18hrs total. The game appears to move too slow to get to a stage where you can actually make a robust educational experience. In Minecraft I can set the stage in advance, how can we make this game work for classrooms? Is there a way to compress the time it takes to get functioning economies up and running etc. From what videos I have watched online, students would spend hours just building the foundation of the society through chopping and mining rocks.  Mini missions, or scenarios where students can drop in to a world already in certain levels of development perhaps?"

I do not teach in a classroom, but help with after-school clubs. This game could definitely be something I would use to incorporate parts of all students' core classes into one fun setting. Having just found out about this today, I noticed that the kickstarter was over and that when you ""buy"" the game, you cannot buy a classroom set (like on the $500 donor level). Will there be an option later to buy this game as a classroom set or would I need to buy the accounts separately and set them up for students? Also, since this game would be used in a club, and the number of students can change on any day (usually anywhere from 5-25 students), if I got a ""classroom set"" would I get a set number of passes to give out as students come, or would I only get access for students that were in the club when I ordered? Finally, if a student moved or left the group, would I have access to ""take back"" the account from the student, clear the account (or transfer everything to myself or ""the public""), and give it to another student that attends the club? If there are any other educators out there looking to incorporate this game into their class or an after-school program, I would love to hear how you are planning on doing so.

eco-as-education,Implementing Writing Skills | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1302/implementing-writing-skills,1374,2,2,rentechd,"Actually my daughter's teacher has been playing with Eco and is working on a grant to get it for her classroom.  One thing that she has come up with for writing was creating worksheets and a 'classroom' book.  One thing she has been trying to get away from was tools that had kids write into a computer as they have many of them and while it re-enforces things like spelling, grammer, sentence structure, etc her classroom has less and less chance to 'write' but does a lot of typing.  Her age group is such that they still need to use handwriting and while they are becoming good typists with all the computer programs they use less and less are lessons being given that a child is using a pencil and paper and this is an important developmental step as well as educational.  She has planned something much like you have here but that the ""character back story"" gets written by the student and goes into a notebook in the classroom.  Then as they work on ""world lore"" they all share in the job of recording that lore on paper and develop the story into chapters that are added to the book so they have a journal associated with their world. She makes a good point here that this also allows the teacher to structure the writing assignments around the level of the student; and to structure the required content accordingly too.  For example, if the game has places to type in back story and world lore and a world journal, the kids would see the direct connect but if a teacher came up with other writing activities and there were not specific places for those activities that kids would tend to find them less important.  Apparently, this has been an issue before as kids have eagerly produced things a game has asked from them and they could enter but when asked by the teacher to do an assignment that was not 'entered' into the game it was greeted by the kids as not being important.  So, if the game is not asking the student to enter this writing into the game then no writing - either what the game asks or the teacher comes up with - is more important then the other.  And it would also leave it up to the teacher as to whether the writing would be handwritten or typed."

I think it is defiantly worth highlighting these features as much as possible as this is a way you can sell it to certain more classical teachers who would see this as just a game and not for what it truly is, if you show them that it is a fun and superior method of doing this you could have a really good market there. I really enjoyed those heat maps and I think you just sold the game to my gf because of it as well so I am presuming she does too . :)"

eco-as-education,Implementing Mathematics | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1301/implementing-mathematics,1856,3,1,ArtisL,"Hey all I just want to share some ideas regarding how Eco could aid pupils understanding of maths.  Pupils often ask a relevant question. ""When will I ever use Maths?"" It is difficult to give real examples sometimes.  This is were Eco could make a real difference. For example allowing a player to carry out a investigation (environmental report) of a species could give information that can be later calculated. For instance a playe could estimate probably time of extinction.  I'm guessing this is something the charts would cover but making it an action a player does would make it more subversive. Just an idea of how this game could make a huge difference. ArtisL"
eco-as-education,Implementing Mathematics | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1301/implementing-mathematics,1856,3,2,Ixidon,"@ArtisL said: I've been already making various calculations about the local, in-game market and how value in items change throughout the server evolution (forces of supply/demand, value of skill gaining per phase, etc) and how inflation affects the market etc. And this is before I even started to look at other stuff, such as pollution change etc, which as insignificant right now (due to limited number of players, thus little impact to the ecosystem). So yeah, I agree that the game can put you into a place where you'll want to use maths / stat analysis in general."

eco-as-education,After-school Club | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/74/after-school-club,2945,3,1,Guest,"I work in a middle school and was looking at the many benefits that this game could provide in a school setting. I do not teach in a classroom, but help with after-school clubs. This game could definitely be something I would use to incorporate parts of all students' core classes into one fun setting. Having just found out about this today, I noticed that the kickstarter was over and that when you ""buy"" the game, you cannot buy a classroom set (like on the $500 donor level). Will there be an option later to buy this game as a classroom set or would I need to buy the accounts separately and set them up for students? Also, since this game would be used in a club, and the number of students can change on any day (usually anywhere from 5-25 students), if I got a ""classroom set"" would I get a set number of passes to give out as students come, or would I only get access for students that were in the club when I ordered? Finally, if a student moved or left the group, would I have access to ""take back"" the account from the student, clear the account (or transfer everything to myself or ""the public""), and give it to another student that attends the club? If there are any other educators out there looking to incorporate this game into their class or an after-school program, I would love to hear how you are planning on doing so. I have a few ideas already and would love to collaborate on making a fun, creative, and thought-provoking game like this as beneficial to students as possible. Thanks!"

The way it works now is with $500 you get access to up to 100 keys per year for 5 years, and students get their copies permanently. Early backers at this tier will be able to have the students involved in development if they like, and get their name in the credits. We'll be turning the school tier back on shortly and youll be able to back that if you want. Feel free to email me with more questions too: john@strangeloopgames.com"

Currently I'm living in Perth but talking to east coast people about this too. Seems like a great way to introduce RE curriculum of the Cool Schools kind. Might give you a call this week to discuss, are you available if I call the school switchboard? I've been following Eco since the Indiegogo launch but only just bought licences to get involved. John K tells me at least one other person in a USA university is interested in 100% RE scenarios. Maybe Eco won't end up the vehicle for this, I was thinking something more like SimCity for a few years, but it's by miles closer than anything I've come across that is open to devs if not fully Open Source (fingers crossed one day for edu it's free given that USA DoE dropped $1m on it!).

I cant officially reply to this. but on a personal view, i think there will be several video and articles that will be user created and and maybe some more from the official developers.
They already released a simple overview on how the modkit will work. Ref: http://www.strangeloopgames.com/how-mods-work-in-eco/
There is also a good website out to help with learning any web language like php. Ref : http://www.w3schools.com/php/ I hope that helps for a start."

Is there any way to get data on the total number of posts in the forums and the total number of articles in the wiki? If there is a specific place in the wiki for Educational Resources I maybe willing to synthesize several of these posts into 1 post for the wiki. I would also like to see beyond the test based wiki a video tutorial of how to do things.
I know from personal experience that some people just do not learn well reading but they thrive with video."
