Said the dirt was rooted or something but there was no tree. I happened to go by it again and I saw a small tree in a small hole that one shovel of dirt would fill. It wasn't the big looking tree that you would see when you plant one but smaller. I hit it with my ax and to my surprise the leaves fell off, then it fell like a normal tree and then I harvested about 20 wood off of it! Keep in mind this is a tree in a 1x1x1 hole. I wish I took a screen shot of it."

game-stories,Settlers in a Strange Land | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5108/settlers-in-a-strange-land,605,4,1,GriffEco,"(This is a story of the server Westbrook, its planet, and the journey of her citizens. I'm Griff Ingalls, the server administrator.  I will make minimal use of admin powers, because I believe regular or excessive use of them damages the Eco experience for all.) Day 1: I am a gatherer.  I'm awful at it, but the huckleberries keep me alive.  I mean, what choice do I have.  I attacked a turtle, but its shell was too much.  No one is that strong.  The fish swim too quickly, and the hares see me well before I see them. Still, there are others.  Even now, one name ""Nick"" speaks of setting up a store.  Still, stores need decent shelter.  No one has that. All the while, a meteor looms overhead.  It's growing larger.  I fear for us all. Day 2: I'm still awful at gathering huckleberries, but the planet seems to notice.  It takes pity and rewards me with a land rich in huckleberry bushes.  Real work can now begin. The others are making quick progress.  I see a store selling boards.  Boards can be crafted into bows, and a bow will improve my life significantly. Nick already has a store established.  The very first beginnings of a town are forming. Day 3: Word of both Nick's store and his virtue has reached the ears of many.  He speaks of strange, magical things like tailings and industry.  Enamored by his words, others follow in his steps. Soon, more stores are built, many taking Nick's credit for their own.  This defacto standard credit kicks the economy into high gear, as the settlers are more easily able to trade goods with one another. Surely, it will be Nick who rises as the people's first World Leader!  Only, he has a challenger.  One named SamuraiOctopi rises to the occasion.  SamuraiOctopi promises even more fantastic things for the people, things like an official backed currency, road planning, and reserves for the world's forests.  Indeed, SamuraiOctopi demonstrates her competence in law craft quickly, to the benefit of all. Nick yields that the use of his own credit by many has burdened him in unexpected ways, and he expresses agreement in the establishment of a backed currency. Day 4: Other towns are forming.  All lands of this fruitful planet are being settled and tamed.  Towns are named, and the people rejoice in their efforts. SamuraiOctopi, through great effort and personal sacrifice, establishes the world's first bank - complete with functioning mint and treasury.  A currency is minted, and the awkward process of adoption begins. The planet's first city is officially named Kawayama.  Its large population shows great potential.  The city has quickly risen as a financial powerhouse. Clear on the other side of the planet is a fertile village called Nekoryumura.  Deep in the taiga, northwest of Kawayama, lies the Land of the Bear. The Land of the Bear undoubtedly holds the title as most advanced.  Xam_Vordek has seen to that personally.  Already a growling steam truck was sighted emerging from the taiga, a testament to their technological and industrial might. Sadly, this was a day of crises. First crisis: Nick declared his intention to retire.  While we may still see him from time to time, it seems his hard working days are over for now. Second crisis:  Kawayama's tailings storage facility suffered a breach, and the threat is real.  The planet's very food supply is in peril.  Land values are plummeting.  Kawayama struggles to decide on a way forward from the disaster."
game-stories,Settlers in a Strange Land | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5108/settlers-in-a-strange-land,605,4,2,GriffEco,"Day 5: Currency and Conundrum The awkward transition to a backed currency continues.  Our glorious world leader SamuraiOctopi assures us this is the best possible course.  The economy does seem to be responding positively.  Increasingly more advanced goods flow quickly, freely, and in ever larger numbers. Our third town was officially named today, Fat Balrog.  A strange name - but the townspeople themselves are good, honest, hard working, and quite sophisticated.  My freshly constructed blast furnace was actually made in Fat Balrog! A second wave of new settlement is upon us!  These young minds with their fresh ideas bode well for the world.  The recently arrived citizenry break ground with spirit, eager to do their part in building a civilization that can turn back the approaching doom. New legislation has slowed.  The only law put forth today, by one named Jimmy, prescribed the absolute prohibition of advanced technologies such as the revered ""Laser"". Let us hope this technophobia is quashed quickly and absolutely. Kawayama's pollution crisis continues.  While the dump was briefly rendered unclaimed, an activist citizen moved quickly to claim it again as his own.   The activist goes by the name of Reppoc850.  His plans are not clear, but hope is kindled none the less. This citizen has managed tailings in the past, and to good effect.  He also has the full confidence of esteemed citizens such as Esira and  even our own world leader herself. Esira has become something of a saint in her own right.  Even as massive pollution threatens the mainland's farms and its very people,  Esira has moved quickly.  Citizens happily attest to her generous nature and the high quality of her signature dish ""Wild Stew"". The industry of the bear growled mightily today.  Much of a substance known as ""concrete"" now issues forth from the machines of Fat Balrog.  Their intentions with this material are, as yet, still unknown.  They are a secretive people.  Ingenious!  Industrious!  But secretive."
game-stories,Settlers in a Strange Land | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5108/settlers-in-a-strange-land,605,4,3,GriffEco,"Day 6: Roads and Resurrection Reppoc850 stepped up mightily today.  The pollution crisis is sure to be resolved soon, and completely. There are a few amongst us who no longer feel the need to contribute.  Our wise leader SamuraiOctopi has deemed now is the time to move against them.  By this time tomorrow, their lands will be forfeit.  The contents of their lands will thus be emptied, for the enjoyment of law abiding citizens everywhere. A brick supply crisis stretched on into its third day today.  Road constructions proceeds slowly as well.  There is progress, but the population show signs of dissatisfaction with the rate of that progress. No new laws were proposed today.  Some potential measures were discussed, but nothing put to pen.  New settlers still arrive without funding, and in a world increasingly devoid of tasty foods easily gathered. Jimmy's Anti-Laser law may well pass.  Jimmy raises concerns that the citizenry will grow lethargic and reclusive, should the meteor be destroyed.  He has convinced many this law will somehow remedy that possibility.  Time will tell."
game-stories,Settlers in a Strange Land | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5108/settlers-in-a-strange-land,605,4,4,GriffEco,"Day 7: Search and Seizure A few citizens have, for the past week, done little or nothing in the face of certain destruction.  Today, examples were made.  Assets were repositioned.  Justice was served.  Mixed emotions were experienced by all, but progress isn't always roses and sunshine. With so little time remaining before the meteor is upon us, we need everyone helping. In brighter news, the road from Kawayama to Nekoryumura was completed.  Some widening and upgrading will be needed, but at least a connection now exists.  Also, a fourth and fifth town might be up for naming in the next day or two! Major steps forward were taken with the pollution crisis in Kawayama.  Legal issues blocking progress have been cleared away.  Notably, the whole of the world seems to be in the midst of an iron production surge.  As such tailings storage facilities are at-capacity and, in some cases, overflowing.  We must find ways to be more efficient with our iron, before it is too late. On the financial side, a credit crisis temporarily bankrupted major corporation president Daily and sent his company's stock price plummeting.  He had this to say ""I'm not authorized on the mint"".  In response the world leader said: ""lol fixed it mb""."

game-stories,How I got greifed off a server | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4688/how-i-got-greifed-off-a-server,916,3,1,MykeMichail,"Okay... I'll start with my experiences in the first couple of hours. I joined the server and was quickly greated with friendly people. I thought I was in a pretty great place. Shortly after starting, the world was wiped, and we started new. It was recommend to me that I go farmer, and not really knowing that much about the game, I went farmer, because it was a highly specialised server and no one had taken it. This was my first mistake. After building Soil Testers for everyone, my skills were practically useless. Saving some stamina on tilling the land when I'm surrounded by cheap food? What's the point? Seed production? I had more seeds than I could ever possibly use. I was running out of space to store them and couldn't sell them, as it seemed people had more than enough of their own. I really wasn't making much. The cook in town was paying me 0.10 for Corn, assuming he had the space to actually take it. He was charging... take a guess? How much do you think they were charging for Corn? It was 0.50. Wowser. So for every piece of corn, with the efficiency this guy had, he paid out 0.10, paid about 0.00001 worth of energy costs in fuel to cook, and took 0.50 per corn. Of course, he wasn't using a full piece of corn, he was only using 0.80 of that corn. His total costs? 0.08001, total revenue, 0.5. Every piece of corn that went through his shop was earning him 0.42. It didn't take me long to figure out, that my patch of corn, 3x8, was barely earning me enough money to pay to harvest my wheat crop, and no one was buying wheat yet. This pattern occurred all over, with a few main people in the designated town square all applying the same pricing practices. If they were passing on any efficiency gains, it was minimal. Most weren't. Most were applying a mark-up. Stores claimed to be buying a particular commodity at a particular price, but they were always full. There was no space to take the inventory. Frequently a price would be advertised, but the store was mysterious disabled. It didn't take me long to figure this... This was deliberate. It was a ruse to give players the impression that things were more expensive that they actually were. The only time you could actually sell anything? You had to sell it at about 15%-20% of the highest bidding offer, or ""the market price"", as players would put it. It was a false economy - you were never, ever, ever, going to get the ""market price"" for what you were selling. The price collusion between players in a small minority, quickly became apparent. Especially when one accidently let slip that he was selling Iron Ingots at half the ""market price"" to one of his mates. But that ""market price"" was factored into the costs of everything they sold, with no efficiency gains passed on. When you sold something? You had to pass on the full efficiency gains. When you bought something? You got none. Of course when the election came around, the little in group who dominated the server and coordinated this price fixing racket were over half the server, who quickly voted in one of their own. Suggest a bill? Instantly opposed. Even if it was in their own favour. They couldn't possible let anyone else pass a bill. Most players, realising the insane monopoly power players on this server were abusing, rapidly quit. Decide to compete with one of their monopolies? Good luck. They just adjust prices so you're no better off and making no money all over again. With massive houses giving huge skill gains bonuses, they could rapidly retrain into any field if you decided to compete with them. Then came research. Withholding supply of materials needed to research particular topics was commonplace, whilst they charged insane amounts of skill scrolls. That Chef? For a Advanced Campfire Skill Book - you needed 3 ingredients. He'd only cook 2. Meaning if you wanted to research it, you were out of luck, unless you spent a tonne of skill points on it, or dropped one of your current specialisations. Then came the fee for service. Want someone to smelt iron for you? Well, be prepared to give up half of your ore! When I denied the price, told them exactly what they would be making at the rate I offered (enough to pay off their Blast Furnace in under 3 hours, vs what they wanted - for me to pay off their blast furnace twice over in the first hour, with a little bit on top). I decided it would be cheaper just to buy my own Blast furnace, and get them to start it for me, and pay them a fee for starting it... They straight up refused to start it for me, citing 'environmental reasons'. Keep in mind, that at this time, as a farmer, I had produced practically ZERO emissions since the game started. In fact the agriculture I had performed was part of the carbon sequestration process. They expected me to pay a premium for my emissions - directly into their pocket. Who did they pay their emissions premium to? Well to themselves of course. I politely refused and they got angry. How dare I deny their price? I walked away, telling them the price they were offering was absurd, and even running the numbers by them. Their excuse for such a high price constantly changed. Seeing as farming was making me practically nothing - I finally decided to just drop it. Everyone was farming their own food anyway. No one was buying the fertilizer I produced, and there was no one to buy the output of my mill. The wheat needed for the baking skillbook? What's the point. The only person who could actually research it was the price gouging chef who cries poor whilst getting 500% back on practically everything he produced. Can I trust him to give me the book back, or even give me a scroll, if I let him research it? I thought about it for a while, and came to the conclusion that I couldn't. It was time to drop farming, milling, fertilizers and every other speciality I had. So I went fully into Smelting and fiiiinally I could smelt all that ore, and offer everyone a great price on ingots. Or, at least I would if everyone else would pass on their efficiency savings to me. But they wouldn't, so I didn't, but still undercut everyone on market. Then the greifing started. Oh no... the greifing. Cutting me off from stores, jacking up prices on things I needed completely needlessly, saying ""Oh look more inflation"" to justify what was simply profiteering, and all the while, these people would cry poor whilst making 200-400% back on every dollar they spent. Whilst I was expected to pass on my efficiency gains in full, they weren't passing on their. Then there was the negative rep - and fake stories about the horrible things I'd done. Claims that I had been given so much support to get me along, and wasted all my skill gains because I couldn't use their furnace for free. The truth? I got absolutely NO assistence. Everything I got was bought and paid for, at exhorbitant prices, and I offered them a fair price for using their blast furnace - they just wanted to be greedy. There's plenty more to this story. I copped plenty of abuse for pointing out how much people were making on things as they cried poor. Was told I was being ""rude"" for disagreeing - like a 40 year soccer mom tells a child they're being rude for having a difference of opinion. Rejecting someone's price was unacceptably - how dare I not pay for goods with 400% markup on them whilst they offer me 1/5 of what it takes to make them for my output? I indicated I planned to create a store in the middle of town? The cronies all decided to claim as much land as possible around town and put cute little signs up saying there was land for sale. Decided I was going to fund some research? The person with the only thing I needed for that research that I couldn't get elsewhere decided to block me from their store, and when I tried using a contract to get around it, they jacked up the price deliberately after that person accepted it, forcing them to take a loss or me to pay for nothing. These people are happy whilst you co-operate and slave away to provide them with everything they need for a pittance. But anyone who spoke up? Disagreed? Pointed out how ridiculous it was? They were called things I can't repeat here. The number of people who came along and quit within a few hours of starting because it was impossible to get anywhere is astonishing. I'm surprised I stuck along as long as I did, but I was hopeful that, given enough time, enough people would enter the server to introduce competition and actually get the ball rolling. Unfortunately, when I finally decided to cut my losses, with a 30 skill point house (which given the circumstances took a lot of effort to create), there were fewer people logging in then there was the day the new map started. Lesson to be learned? Friendly faces don't always mean friendly people. Run your numbers. If they don't add up, challenge it. If they won't play ball, don't play with them at all."

In diablo the most important is power leveling and diablo 3 legendaries, based on the whole game. If you start playing now it is best to buy power leveling right away to catch up with more experienced players. In Diablo 3 the most important are the legendary items and wings, wings like Cosmic Wings, if you want to buy Cosmic Wings it is best to do it on Odealo.

Back in mid July there was a guy (who we will ""this/that guy"") that was doing a pretty good job being world leader on our server. He got a huge group of people to work together to make a really big town. The only thing this guy wanted from his people was their loyalty and their property claim flags, so the town could expand. It eventually got really big and started bordering my property. I asked him to either add me to his deed, so I could mine the area where he had claimed next to where I had claimed, or unclaim that property. He didn't respond. Eventually, I get pretty sick of this guy continuing to claim land that directly bordered my land and not cock blocking me from my ore and sand. So I dump a stockpile's worth of tailings in the river right next to my house, which was also really close to where they had their wheat farms. Now, my land had been habitually polluted because I was the only one buying tailings, so they could be stored properly. I mean, sometimes people would sell me 60 tailings while I'm offline and 8 hours later when I get on, my land looks like the surface of mars. So, I go and dump 120 tailings in the river to get his attention, cause obviously being polite and asking him isn't working. It should also be noted that I hated this guy because the server got rolled back and that caused this guy to get the elections skill book before I did, instead of the other way around before the server had to be rolled back. So I was in a really bad mood. I dump these tailings in the river and they all flip out more so than usual. However, it does get his attention and I say, ""I'll remove the tailings if you unclaim the land that directly borders me."" So, he then claims all the land around me and blocks me in entirely. Eventually, we settle down and he unclaims the land to the west of my property, but keeps the land that directly borders my eastern side. and I remove the tailings. And he claims the river. Things go back to ""normal"" for a few days. He and his people build a bridge across the ocean and claim the bridge obviously. Then a new group forms their own town on the other continent that the bridge went to. A few days pass and the new people get their town up and running pretty well. They make their own currency and what not. Then things go crazy. That guy was always voted to be the world leader in the elections. He just bribed people to vote for him and that's how he won. When this new town gets up and running however, one of them runs for world leader and they are going to win. There is nothing that guy can do about it, except threaten his citizens to vote for him instead. He also threatens to revoke everyone's ability to use his shops because, since all the land was owned by him, he owned all the shops. He could also see who voted for him and who didn't because the voting system is broken like that, so it was really easy for him to see who he should remove. So he removed everyone, except me because I didn't want to be on his bad side, from the ability to use his shops or access anything on his land. I think some of his citizens still had perms, but not all. He also claimed all the land around the new people's town. When I say he claimed all the land, he went from owning like 25,000 square meters to owning about 35,000 square meters after he claimed all the land around the new town. Obviously, this made a lot of people really mad. A member of the new town was also a newly made admin of the server we played on. The new admin had a chat with that guy and it did not go well. That guy had obviously lost his mind or something. He was also very uncooperative with the admins, so the admins banned him, unclaimed all his property and for lack of a better word, peace came to the server."

One of the guys there decided to ""expand"" his house into a tower... and later on just started building a single block sky tower. As people ran out of resources, others joined in, and thinking we would hit the height cap soon, we kept building into the 900's. Someone suggested this should get recorded, so I did. Later on we passed 1000 blocks and the tower can be seen from REALLY far away. One plan is to store the pollution there. Now the server has crashed, hopefully the tower was not the reason.

Four complete strangers we were but we got together on a Danish ECO server that had the word 'Teamwork' in its title. Only 2 days and 11 hours in, we've already made an oven among other things. All of us sticking to their own specific professions (Mason, Smith, Chef, Engineer) with only one goal, to make a sprawling city and reach the latest tech asap. I love it, having put any issues aside and just researching together instead of everyone starting with one profession and then jumping to the next all at once. Got some high-res screenshots on the town in its current state, which at its speed of progression will soon turn into electrical powered lamps, asphalt roads and more varying looks on the structures.

I am excited for every step that I take in the game, I smiled as we finally got the cement kiln to start tunnel out smoke out of the chimney and that's when I checked and realized that air pollution in the game already exists, it just hasn't been recognized with the minor numbers in using coal as a fuel creates. Cement building parts craftable too?! I can't wait to keep researching all the stuff, and to actually drive around in the soon to be ""powered cart"". For the first time today I finally had some uses of a simple cart by transporting stones from our mines up to the new cement kiln. Five stones to make one single asphalt road not taking into consideration the cost reduction skills, I think ""efficiency"" skills is the name. We've got work to do... Our Chef has finished researching all the Culinary skills.
So has our Mason with his tech.
Now we await the researching of Steel and Electronics to be able to create everything that the Engineer has been waiting for. Even his very first Mechanics skills rely upon Metallurgy's late-game tech so we have been idly waiting."

We are researching refining and industry which will be followed by electronics and computer lab. In the meanwhile, our most commonly used word by now is probably ""stone"". Having laid out plans for a 4 block wide asphalt road to go around the world (4000x asphalt road/ramps), I believe I have some stone mining to do. I am so far Level 3 on Cement production efficiency (oh and as a Chef I did take over our Mason's duties as he has been gone for a few days) so we are at least not depleting the world as we make our roads. And fortunately, we will have the powered cart running down and up the mine soon to make the work a tad bit easier. One of the out of town roads have been successful as we have speeded down 20x ramps for the pure joy of being at least 3 times faster than someone running without dragging a cart along, and we did transport 120x coal in one run to our neighbour Mazde29 whom we openly and freely trade things with. I have managed to take a lot more great screenshots found in link above (some of them absolutely gorgeous!) and I hope I get to find out what the other half of the game progression will be like."

The time before i was not really sure about the game, because i do not trust alpha games. But the new alpha 4 sounded great in my ears and i decided to invest 38€ (40$) and.... wow!
At the moment i am still alone in my world, because i wasn´t able to convince my best friend - damnit. I am going to do this later :D The first moments (first hour) of gameplay was quite hard - didnt know any combinations and gameplay techniques without wiki help about alpha 4 (it was some hours after release). At the moment i have quite a few buildings (four) at two different places. My first big project was the street between them. So much high level difference - so much curves....strasse.jpg
Done it quite well, the first car helps me much. Its not that easy to drive there, but i will fix it later. The moment of the street building beginning was that moment, where i start loving that game. Some problems and issues at the moment - but i will trust you to develop that in the future. Please apologize my bad english, i am quite improving my skills.
More later :)"

Good suggestion on making roads wider then 2 to prevent carts from getting stuck. My main concern there is ramps are 2 wide and you would have to place two next to each other for ramp areas. Suggestion: Either make cart narrower or allow for single line ramps.

So with the current state you definately need 2 ramp wide lanes to move comfortably... But yes nice street and i hope you stay on course :) Good luck would like to read and see more of your settlement. Regards

thank you for your good and nice answers. Of course I want to write more, but I was not at home.
At the moment I have
a little farm,
a mine,
some buildings, The next goal is the working with minerals.
The rubbish could be stored in this hole, before I bring it in another bigger stone area - but well, I have to figure out how that really work :D  To provide a efficient output, I want a bigger building or an industrial area. As I need a flat area, I began to drive away the dirt. The carts are really helpful and are necessary for town development. I builded another one as the first one disappears for some hours O.o  To store the dirt until I need it, I build another small house.  Well thats not so much, but in the near future I have more time to play eco.  There is enough place to build up a really nice industrial complex...."

For highways for the powered cart I like to build 8 blocks wide or 4 ramps.  Streets for regular cart I like 4 blocks wide or 2 ramps.  This gives you plenty of space to fail and have enough time to correct course. Then I like 2 block wide for my foot paths. Always good to have walls to stop you from falling off.

game-stories,"Ecosystem test ruined, and yet successful | ECO Forum",https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/189/ecosystem-test-ruined-and-yet-successful,2810,3,1,Tarahu,"Yesterday I logged in to find a stripped area and figuring this was bad environmental management I travelled aorund the world to an empty spot and set up a village on a large natural stone slab next to a river. I set about cutting every second tree and made up for the lack of wood by supplementing with stone. this worked fantastically to maintain minimal impact on the ecosystem... i thought.
The wolves started to increase slightly and I noticed the numbers of rabbits and deer dropped. As the deer decreased the grass increased quite rapidly and berries and bulbs grew naturally. The forest was supplying my needs through the reduction of deer, although my protein intake was almost zero. Despite this I set up some small paddocks of berry and wheat plots then logged out. I logged on today to find a few other players had decided to set up near me... they did nto have the environmental management I did and the trees had been stripped from the land. my farms had half rotted, the deer and rabbits were all dead or dying, and the grasses did not grow any where near as quickly. There were no wolves to be seen.
A few very small trees were starting to peak out from the destruction, but I had no illusions to them lasting long considering that unlike myself, the other players had used wood logs exclusively to build their buildings. So my land was totally ruined... and the ecosystem worked perfectly. Just like in the real world even the bust sustainable practices can be destroyed by the unwise."

I am working on a town and first named it Meteor Alley, but seeing how on my server the Meteor is a year away I decided the name isn't as appropriate.  So instead I thought came to me that I would just name it as it progressed.  I started it out as ""Settlement""  Few buildings here and there two to three citizens.  Then eventually when I thought we ""leveled up"" as a community I renamed to ""Village"" This applied to the time of lumber and mortared stone. Coming up next is ""Town"" and that will be when we build up a Town Hall."
game-stories,In the Night | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/452/in-the-night,5309,11,1,anna,"So I was playing on a server with my brother... The server, despite having been advertised on the forum, was completely empty except for us two. All the animals were gone, and apparently it was day 138 or something, but the meteor was still ominously circling the globe. So we settled down and started making a city. There were no laws, so we chopped down a ton of trees and eventually had a nice game going for ourselves. There were no trees where we claimed our town, so no one could chop anything down and make ugly stumps. There was a rock shelf nearby, where we decided to put anything that produced waste. To see what waste looked like, I made a trash compactor, and had a lot of fun turning bushgrass seeds into trash. All the trash stacked up inside a little stone box. My brother was more of a miner (I made a bakery, shops, and a Town Hall), so he made a refinery on the rock shelf. It was a fine refinery, and he made sure all the waste was on stone (we didn't know what waste did to grass). We wondered what waste-water looked like. So I shoveled some garbage and put it right next to a river (far away), but nothing happened. I assumed garbage just didn't affect anything this early in game development, and went back to our town. The next day, my brother and I went on the server to find a completely ruined town. Literally EVERY block of grass was dead and nuclear-waste-y, and all of our plants were dead. We laughed so hard. It was great. Anyway, my brother started shoveling garbage, and I helped, and once all the garbage was gone the grass turned back to normal (wish that happened in real life). Apparently while the garbage was left sitting overnight, one garbage block was touching a grass block and it all spread from there. I still haven't found the river where I put my waste-water garbage..."
