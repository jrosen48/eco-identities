game-servers,Commercial server Host's | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/653/commercial-server-host-s,18266,17,3,rentechd," Killservers has been providing Eco Servers since Alpha 3 and has a in-depth knowledge of hosting and managing Eco Server as well as providing customized configurations for the server owner to easily understand the settings they are choosing.  Our standard servers for Eco is a server that will allow you to have a world up to 200X200 without needing to ask for extra RAM.   We don't sell by slots as Eco Server is not set up to have slots equal RAM like with some other games.  With Eco you can have 2 players or 100 players and that will not increase your RAM needs - how big a world you make will increase your RAM needs. The more players the more CPU and each server has the necessary CPU for 100 players. We provide you enough RAM to host as many as you like join you on the world size of your choice. We have a video here on how to use our servers and you can get a look at how our game panel works:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nBuzwK9oom0   This also demonstrates the custom Configuration Editor you have to the server which give access to every configuration option for the server, some hosts limit but we provide full access but through the custom editor the setting is explained and you do not have to directly edit the json file] We have several public servers online, including ones for Bleeding Edge testing of new code,  - two are in the UK and several are in the US!  See what our servers are like. If you currently have a world on your home computer or in another space and would like that world to come with you we can facilitate the world move. Standard Servers are 20.00  USD monthly and you get get  all you need for a full Eco Server with a large would without having to come back and purchase more resources   We do not offer servers with less then what you need to run your choice of world sizes up to 200X200 and support unlimited players.  We found that providing servers with less resources usually brought the owner back with issues of not being able to build a world size they wanted or host the numbers they wanted and then the price would go up according to what they wanted added to the server to meet tehir needs.  For Eco we decided to provide servers from the start that allowed an owner to have a configurable server according to game needs. We also make sure that you have access to all versions of the Eco Server including the stagings and bleeding edge stagings and all viable back versions. Gameserver Features We have been providing Eco Servers for Hosting since the first server release of Eco over two years ago at the release of Alpha 3, our support team has experience with game mechanics as well as technical issues.  We don't provide servers with limited amounts of resources which require you to then to upgrade and purchase more resources when you find you cannot configure the size of your world without more RAM/CPU/Storage more resources  You actually get what a 4KM2 Eco world needs to run a challenging world. If you want to talk about a server or have more questions you can contact  Pam in the ECO Discord Server or Killservers DIscord Server We look forward to helping you host an amazing Eco World.https://www.killservers.com/"

For example,
We host Minecraft, Terraria, Starbound, Rust, ARK, Space Engineers, etc to name a few :/ I assume the reason @Endimmion may of opted not to implement SSO is due to the fact that the website's end-users may very well use different usernames/aliases on a per-server basis,
either that or @Endimmion just haven;t gotten around to implementing it yet ;)"

If we had only one server list, the problem would be the same, you would have to create also an account on server list for other games made by different people.
For several reasons that I don't want to expose here, I have designed all my server lists to be independent websites. That being said, I can assure you that it doesn't take more than 1 minutes to register on one of our server list :-)"

Make sure that Description is the variable used for your Server name as the value in that field would be what shows up in the browser.  If your looking in the ""Recommended windows theh you may not see your own server depending on the playtime setting  and server category in the Network.eco as well as a few other things where you may not have a high level to match your own server.  The best what to check your server is to go to ""Browser All"" and in there bring up all servers and then sort by Age and you should see yourself in there for the age of your server which is the quickest way to look. My understanding is that most PingPerfect clients don't have direct access to the configuration files like other providers do but that you can access the config files (there are 17 if them  https://gyazo.com/3e65374f17df7d2bbeafefb660265407) via FTP.  You will probably want to get a  copy of the most up to date configs to be working from as many providers do not have them up to date and they are not updated on install of the server.  You can go to the Official Eco Discord and in the #Offciial-support channel they can help you get those for your use.  The Network.eco shout look like this: https://gyazo.com/31c7205c8962b1930341d806c82a2559 . Some providers do block or overwrite the network.eco as it is where they set the IP and port they assign you and they do not want those changed by the server owner accidently as then they would conflict with other servers.  That is not the case with all providers, a few do have another way to make sure that does not happen and do provide you with full access to all configuration files.  I think those that do provide full access not that in their information in the Commercial Servers Section of this forum"

game-servers,creating with hamchi possible? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5497/creating-with-hamchi-possible,41,2,2,rentechd,"Eco does not work well with Hamachi.  A few Hamachi ""experts"" have reported that thy have done it and enabled connections that what but that its not always been very stable.  The servers is very much set up to use port forwarding for internet connections and if you are all on a LAN then you could all connect to Eco easily with using hamachi.  The problem is that using Hamachi to make Eco think its all a LAN connection posses issues. You have two options basically for hosting friends to play.  One is if using Steam you can create a Eco Client world that sets up and allows players to connect to you using Steam Invite and Steam Join.   The world would not be listed in the server browser so people would need to know when you are in the game playing and so they could use join or receive an invite from you through steam. The other option is to set up a dedi server either using the Server in the Tools Library or installing through SteamCMD.  You will need access to your router and know how to port forward as well as the proper ways to configure your Firewall.  If you all on on the same LAN (behind the same router) you should be then able to see the server without  having to deal with router settings.  But otherwise you would need to do this. The downside to running a residential server is the bandwidth you have an that often ends up giving you a poor experience for your players which leaves investigating a game server host. The Wiki has a good Server section about the different ways to set up the servers but other then one example we can not help with router or firewall setups as they are outside our support focus but you should be able to check your ISP support pages for how to do port forwarding if the allow that and your firewall software should have support pages for how to configure it. You can also get a bit quicker help with server setups in the #Official-Support channel in the Official Eco Discord."

here's the problem:
I was playing in a server and suddenly I was kicked out of it by the game saying that there was a connection problem. I tried to join again, and it said the same thing. I closed the game and opened it again and the server was gone. There is no ""Continue"" because it says ""Can't find server to continue"".
In ""Your worlds"" in the ""recent"" tab there is a line with 35% of match, but it has no name, no age and no ping, nothing at all. It just says ""offline"" in the bottom right corner.
Now, I can't remember the name of the server, nor if I used a server I found on Ecoserver.io or if I began a new game.
The only things I remember are:
when I voted on a law, the internet page was http://68.184.72.221:3001 but there is nothing anymore;
There was an election in progress and the only candidate was Duvessa, which has a huge shop in that world.
Can anybody help me, please? I'd really like to get back on that server.

I was fascinated from the footage I found around the net, bought the game and started playing. I really enjoy the dev's focus on gameplay instead of graphics. The way the game is designed, the way multiplayer and collaborating with other players works is a really satisfying concept in my mind. I joined a few Servers, but I didnt really find what I was looking for, so hands on deck, I decided to start my journey on a new world in my own server. I decided that the triple time (90 days instead of 30) would be a good time for a beginner who does not have too much time to play to defeat the meteor. Other settings are pretty much default. My worlds size is 2.07 square kilometers. Now im on the search of other eco enthusiasts who want to work together to build a thriving economy. I want to keep it realisic, so right now we would be just a bunch of outlaws. A government will be formed when we, the citizens organize ourselfes by ourselfs and when there is need to. Currency, a labour market, trading, infrastructure... all these system will organically be set in place by the players themselfes, when the time comes. You want to connect to others? Build a road! You dont want to do all the work on yourself? Pay other players to do the labour for you! You need food or resources to get your business started quick? Look for a contract with someone who needs your help. Bring value to people and people will happiely pay you. What I am trying to say is that everthing will develop organically, and nothing will be cheated or put in place by adminpowers. Intrested?
Have a look at http://dumperjumper.com/eco I did not have much time to create content yet, but there will be tons of information, a forum, a blog with news and sites for ingame businesses. If you want to join directly, use dumperjumper.com See you ingame,

You can guess by my user name that I am not that savvy about community-based, online games; I ask for your indulgence while I try to sort this out. My son is 13, on the Autism spectrum, with everything that entails, mathematically gifted and game obsessed. Plays Magic: The Gathering at a pretty sophisticated level, but social cues are not his strong point, even in person, never mind online.
I am looking for a server to which I can direct him that will be kind, generous and understanding. We as a family lean pretty heavily toward the tree hugger, environmentally aware, renewable energy point of view and I am hoping that I can find a server that at least somewhat aligns with these values.
Please understand that I do not want to start searching out servers on my own, trying them out and so on. My computer is so out of date, I doubt it would even run the game. I also have more than enough on my plate right now, so I am just hoping for a quick ""oh, by all means, your son should sign up to fillintheblank server, they will be very welcoming"" Thank you to any and all responders, I appreciate your time and forthrightness.

Most of the time by day 4 or 5 they have shutdown the server or have erratic online times or have a leader that does whatever they want making crazy laws that only benefit they (like crazy high taxes) but the worst one happened tonight. A server owner named Lolli (who I would avoid at all cost) had a world still on day one so I join and find a nice little island to do my own thing. then after a couple hours they shutdown the server which I have begrudging used to all servers doing then when it comes back up they now own my property now belongs to Lolli and even though they are online and moving around they will not respond to me. They have lost a costumer today because they are unwilling or unable to afford their own servers. They have two servers but who wants to join a game a week into it? There needs to be fresh servers to join that people can count on to be stable places to play. They either need to put up the money to run more servers or allow toxic server owners to ruin their game (which I enjoyed playing while I could).

Official servers - which we have - wouldn't fix your problem though, as they are completely unadministrated.

The game's ""like Minecraft"" way down underneath but that's not really part of it, the  benefits from cooperation and specialization and social structure are so dramatic the Minecraft-y parts are subsumed, they're not the interesting bits, they don't factor in to the gameplay as more than diversions while you get to know the neighbors and figure out a plan. Especially with r8 you retreading the same paths others on the server are already mastering is just pointless waste and pollution.  You divvy up the skills and figure out transport. One takes carpentry one takes fishing one takes basic engineering one takes mining one takes hunting one takes etc. Fire up an SP world or a localhost server (the server works as well on Linux as anywhere now afaict, I just mono EcoServer.exe now with an up-to-date mono and ta-daa) set on ""No Cooperation"" to experiment with the skills if you haven't got anybody you already know into the game yet and you don't want to go through all the embarrassing noob clumsiness in public."

Then said you weren't coming back. Something about 'going back to RUST'.
I actually respected your choice here.
We actually helped you alot to start up cause we needed a smith. and asked you 3 time to sell iron bar so we could advance ourselves. You did not comply. Instead you rushed to the assembly line witought telling us and always saying you needed more iron ore. So we did give you tons of it so we could have iron bars.Witch we never had.
I actually gave you the benefit of the doubt that you would have actually kept your word . Being quick to turn on someone?.. come on..I actually endured your condescending comments for several days. Learn some respect and to be more humble. Several time you were actually looking down on me witought even knowing me. So yeah thanks to ruins the fun here buddy, you must be proud."

""you were basically complaining about not helping you to speed run the whole thing"" no, I mined myself to get more iron ore to get an assembly line so I could craft a blast furnace because I didn't fancy digging another huge tailings area when it could be prevented and then I would be fine selling all the iron you guys needed. I spent a good 8 hours just mining to create the area for tailings and getting iron to get the machines. but I guess you guys couldn't wait 1 day to save more time, plus if you needed iron so bad why didn't someone else just become a smith?
""We actually helped you alot to start up"", no not really giving someone some chared papaya isn't ""alot of help""  so you cant act as I owe you my left leg over some food.
""endured your condescending comments"" please give me some examples I actually want to know what I said that was condescending, I wrote the quick to turn part because of you taking all my machines and changing the signs on my base.

-Players can do as they wish
-It's encouraged to work together
-Politics get rough, don't quit because you lose
-Players should handle any disputes between themselves
-Limited Admin intervention
-Bannable offenses are excessive trolling, cheating, or hacking.
-Dedicated server based in Dallas
-The server backups ever hour Premise of server: I have played the game for about two weeks and during the few servers I played on I was banned for simply running for president or disagreeing having an opposing view. The result was creating a server to let human err and freewill precipitate without admin intervention. This sort of game play will not be desirable for everyone. I do believe it will interest many people that can pursue whatever their intentions are. This is important to me as it is realistic.  The server has been up just over a week and the political climate has changed and has been somewhat dramatic. The meteor is coming. Will a divided people come together to survive? Human freewill and greed are some of the most dangerous things there are. On a server such as this, the meteor is the least threatening thing when people don't get banned for simply having their own views or aspirations. This allows for parties to form based on their own beliefs and geographical locations without being censored via a ban."

We have launched both the community and the server on the 27th August 2018.
We have acquired a stable server which will be able to support a large amount of players and bring people together as one community. We have lots of different ideas for the server and I am sure you have too. Some people like Politics, building a strong economy or even saving the ecosystem. We want ALL of this. We would love multiple groups of people fighting for government, an active political democracy and an economy in which people can buy and sell with ease. We want to welcome new players all the time! We will make everyone and anyone welcome and support them when we can. This could start with giving them a few logs at the start and in the future it might mean a law in which poorer citizens gain gradual income. It’s all up in the wind and we will decide together. Want to check out our current laws? Click on the following link.http://185.175.139.115:3011/ We also have a discord. We use it as a platform to talk to each other about things both in the game and outside of the game, whether that is with voice or with text. Everyone can join. Support in game will be included. Paradox Gaming Discordhttps://discord.gg/uKS2vpC We have tweaked a few settings in the game. We have a 3km² world in which anyone can join. Not happy with your professions and skills? We have a refund rate of 70%!
How long do we have to destroy the meteor? 30 days! This may sound like a lot to take in but once in-game, it will be easy and a lot of fun. You have read all of this and finally want to join? No worries. 185.175.139.115:3010 - This is the IP to our server

I'm looking to setup a sever for Eco. I have a Nitrado server that I used for Ark and I want to convert it to Eco. I was able to switch the game from Ark to Eco and even play on it for a time. My problem is that I can't change the settings on the server so that more than one person can play on it. Myself and 5 friends want to play together, but we get Compatible Version errors every time. I have a feeling that it is due to the fact that I don't know what I'm doing or Nitrado is not good for Eco Servers.

You need to be prepared to keep the server up to date, or to tell your players to run a unified older beta until you have a chance to update.

Skill cost are reduced by half for each specialty trees due to our current population of 5-10 active players, and collaboration difficulty is set to low to improve our chances of survival in this difficult planet. We have an active but small community of players from North America. We use discord's voice chat at http://discord.deeperimpact.ca/ to communicate with each other, but it's not a requirement. Further details to the server's planet would be easily accessible from http://www.deeperimpact.ca/ The server is hosted on a dedicated machine in New York, controlled by ftp and web interfaces so it's easily accessible by me and whoever I appoint as sub admin. It makes 4 backups per day, every 6 hours and keeps up to half a week's worth of backups. And since this server runs straight vanilla gameplay, it should pose little problem to the stability for the players in the future of updates (hopefully). Good luck, have fun!"

game-servers,Lokking for admin position | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4696/lokking-for-admin-position,860,5,5,Funnybunnyofdoom,"The fasted way to become admin is to run your own server. You can host it on your PC for friends, you can dedicate a machine to running it 24/7, or you can lease a rented host like killservers or pingperfect. It's not likely that I would give you admin permissions. In fact, I usually play with admin off even as the admin. We do not want the temptation to spawn items, give skill points, or something along those lines. Most things I have found that require mediation either handle themselves through gameplay (territory and market disputes) Only twice have I actually had to use the banhammer. Most servers have frequent backups, and an active community. If someone griefs beyond repair, you can usualy wait until the owner gets on. I've seen few servers with more than 1 admin, never more than 3. However, if you want to become an admin really badly just join the server you like. Get on every day, mostly all day. Learn their names, the staff structure, and get to know them. Use discord to communicate with them, and after you're on a casual greeting basis, then you can make your intentions know. Also, you may need to improve your typing skills. I know several things from your post:"

Upon the restart of the server with a fresh world, it was agreed among the admin to set refunds to 10%, with very high collaboration,  but the same issues of the skill bonuses being manipulated without community notification occurred, just like  the world before.  I noticed when refunding a skill I received 50% refund, I got upset because I requested that once the server was started, that the rates should not be changed, and I realized I was ignored. So a few days later it was noticed by the community that crafting gave a skill point bonus, and at a very high rate, and refunds again were at 50%. Again all this was blamed on server resets. Very upset at this point I refunded again, to take advantage of the manipulations I was sure Admin created for personal gains in the game. The next day mods were added that made carts hold 9kg, and lots of new food, and up-gradable tools, all added with out consulting the community. The irony of this situation is that very high collaboration and very low refund was designed to keep progress slow, but the moded food bonuses just reversed that... Five days later, ten days into the server, I announced me and my buddy were ready to kill the meteor, and what followed in discord was full condemnation of me and my buddy for taking refunds, and how we were exploiters. So we called out admin for making changes, where it was admitted the crafting bonuses were changed, but both Pam and Art_illary insisted restarting the server caused the skill refunds to revert to default. That is when my buddy who is a programmer announced he had run his own server, and those  fields do not change without manual input to the server. There was an argument that resulted in Pam threatening to ban us if we chose to continue to debate the subject. We did not want to get banned so we shut up, and the next day when we were ready to kill the meteor, I understood the last time I asked for a good time to destroy it, we almost got banned, so I made the decision to do it.  Over the next tree days, we were harassed by many people, including the admin everyday, being called names, and accused of griefing the server, even though we had never done anything to warrant this. Today I had enough of the harassment, and told Arti he was acting like a child, and I got banned. This is a warning, and a notification, if you like some of the worst server lag in ECO, constant server restarts, admin abuse of skill bonuses, admins acting like dictators, and being forced through peer pressure to conform or be harassed out, then this is the place for you."

And the disrespect he treated the admiring with for doing nothing more then fixing this so they worked. He is trying to make you think this is why he was banned.  This was several days before his ban and he was banned because he was harnessing and antagonizing and being totally inappropriate with a lady on the server.  He was asked to stop and instead came back and started in on her again.  After having been told after the 'cheating' episode and one with the harassment that he would be banned if the behavior continues,  He was when it did. had already been warned about starting trouble as he had with accusing the admin of cheating for fixing the server and he was warned about inappropriate behavior.

I will let all reading this guess which road he picked that resulted in his being banned from that discord also. One of the reasons you don't see admins sharing lists of people that are banned from server due to behavior, harassment, and other violations is that SLG does not get involved in ""outting"" banned.

IP Adress : 91.121.185.20:10215 La philosophie de Prismatia est simple :
un règlement minimum pour libérer le potentiel de chacun, sans frustrations et/ou peur du ban/kick. (Vous êtes libres tant que vous respectez la propriété d’autrui et le monde dans son ensemble).
Esprit vanilla (garder un gameplay épuré de “mod”)
Une progression ni trop rapide, ni trop lente. “medium” avec un gain de point actif sur la récolte/destruction de bloc (celui ci étant très faible, il favorise le début de jeu mais ne dépasse jamais 50% de vos gains passif)
Un objectif simple mais difficile dans un contexte presque anarchiste : détruire l'astéroïde. Règle de vie commune minimum :
Respect de la propriété: Créez votre propre ville ou si vous souhaitez rejoignez un groupe. (Demander la permission aux joueurs d’une zone pour claim près de chez eux).
Respect de l’agriculture: évitez de construire une zone polluante proche d’une zone à fort potentiel agricole (vérifier par le biais de votre carte) La vie sur Prismatia
Faites du commerce, des échanges ! Il n’y aucune restrictions de monnaie sur prismatia.
N’hésitez pas à saluer les nouveaux venu, faites des rencontres pour construire à plusieurs des lieux communautaires (route, mine, champ partager ect ..)
Gagnez la course à la technologie en étant le premier à mettre en place des lasers ! Caractéristique technique du serveur :
Une carte d’environ 2/3 km² pour 30 joueurs maximum
Un serveur multiplay fiable (le serveur a un uptime de 99%)
Une configuration vanilla où la pollution a tout les effets négatif possible"

Draken Rising is a private server that could use a few good citizens. We have implemented a standard currency called Drakes and we have a strong infrastructure including a great network of roads, a helpful and friendly community, a Treasury, and a Mint. We have a marketplace area zoned for small shops where you will be able to trade even with offline players. We are working on a price-guideline sheet that will help players calculate their costs and suggest prices for all the items in the game. We need more people covering professions throughout the course of the day and night. We are aiming to have at least two people on each profession to maximize the likelihood of there being someone online. I will work with you to find roles that are needed on our server as new players join. We have a Discord server where most players on voice chat. All new players will receive an invite to it, though it is not necessary to use the voice chat. In-game chat works just as well if you do not have a mic or do not like to talk. I use text channels on the Discord to circulate polls and surveys as well as proposals and agendas for our once-weekly server Town Meetings. I try to solve all problems on the server very democratically. Controversial issues that crop up on the server are addressed at the weekly Town Meetings and followed up with a poll of all citizens which determines the direction of the server. For an example of a meeting, see a recording of last Saturday’s meeting here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/239760688?t=00h23m14s We emphasis cooperation and a strong economy on our server. There is a starting package for new players of 50 skill points and 30 Drakes, which should allow for more freedom and the ability to gain a profession quickly so that you can buy and sell goods to support yourself. There is also a free food chest in Town Hall which contains tier one foods and raw ingredients to prevent new players from starving. We also have a Contract Board set up in the town’s center, which allows players to hire each other to complete specific tasks. If you find yourself running into trouble or in need of a job to do, just message me and I’ll help you find whatever you need. If I’m unavailable, there are plenty of helpful citizens around at all hours to assist you. We have about 10 regulars who play during the day (EST) and some during the night (EST). The server has been up for 18 days, though most of the past week has been spent figuring out how to implement the standard currency in a fair manner. The meteor is currently scheduled to hit in about 12 days; we will be holding a vote over the options to keep the meteor, move its impact date back, or remove the meteor from the game. We are looking for players who are age 18+. English is our prefered language. Timezone and total daily availability are not important, as long as you can play regularly. You should be able to at least log on to feed yourself daily. If interested in joining Draken Rising, send a message to /u rythana on reddit or username rythana2 on the Eco game forums. I will be interviewing any interested gamers. After the short interview, I will supply the Discord link and server info, including password. Hope to see you in game! rythana"

Also working on getting my Grassland Gathering and connecting nodes leveled. My other skills include most of the Construction building parts such as Wood Construction and Stone Construction, and I am working on getting more points for whatever construction is left over. And very willing to help build new player shops and homes if they just ask. In terms of our economy, I have various jobs that any new player can assist with. I pay based on the items harvested. Most of my jobs require the person to mine stone and move dirt, occasionally I will ask for logs. Nothing too fancy. Speaking of money, I am also the one who has decided to undertake the responsibility of attempting to price every item in the game.

(Ou bonne nuit ... ?) ""Les Veilleurs de Monde"" est une communauté de joueurs multi-MMORPG qui prônent l'Honneur, l'Entraide, la Solidarité, le Courage, le Panache et le Respect de tous.
Ils sont connus et représentés en ""guilde"", ""confrérie"" ou ""clan"" dans les jeux et par leur diminutif ""Les Veilleurs'.
Leurs couleurs sont l’Azur et l’Or symbolisant l’Aube et son Astre.
Chaque Veilleur est dépositaire de ces valeurs. Pourquoi avons-nous choisi Eco ? Tout simplement parce que ce monde nous semble important à protéger (ouai, vous avez bien lu, nous ne voulons pas tout raser comme de simples sauvages !) et qu'il nous permettra également de représenter certaines de nos valeurs comme l'entraide (qui est plus qu'important dans Eco) ainsi que d'exprimer notre côté RP. Nous avons également apporté quelques modifications mineures à l'expérience de jeu : de nouvelles recettes sont présentes, ainsi que l'amélioration d'objets (comme les bibliothèques permettant d'entreposer des livres, ...). Aucune modification n'a lieu concernant les points de compétences ceci-dit. Comment nous rejoindre ? Notre communauté dispose à ce jour d'un serveur Eco, et nous serions heureux de vous y accueillir. Nous disposons également d'un discord, de manière à pouvoir y présenter les règles propres au serveur ainsi qu'à pouvoir y favoriser les échanges. A l'heure actuelle, nous souhaitons un premier contact discord/forum de manière à ne pas avoir de sauvages de passage prêt à ravager les terres de notre nouveau monde. Pour cela, vous pouvez prendre contact avec moi-même ou un autre administrateur sur notre discord (le lien est plus haut, rappelle toi).
La seule chose à savoir avant d'arriver : nous cherchons des joueurs prêt à s'investir un minimum et mâture ! Nous sommes actuellement environ 5 joueurs de notre communauté et avons déjà quelques heures à notre actif. L'ouverture est en fait une réinitialisation de notre serveur de manière à pouvoir accueillir d'autres membres. Nous sommes actuellement complet sur le serveur. En espérant bientôt vous voir !"

Ou peut être bonsoir si c'est le soir ! Qu'en sais-je ? La communauté présente sur le serveur Ecoveillons décide d'effectuer un nouveau départ. C'est dans cet optique, que nous décidons également d'ouvrir le nombre de poste de travailleurs investis à environ une trentaine de joueurs - ce qui laisse donc une vingtaine de places de libres ;) ! Youhou ! Les règles du serveur sont en train d'être édicté par les premiers fondateurs, de manière à ce que le jeu et la vie en communauté se déroule du mieux possibles.
Quoi qu'il en soit, le serveur disposera au minimum de l'Astéroïde, de nouvelles recettes de cuisines, de l'amélioration d'objets de bases ainsi que de la possible définition d'une monnaie unique (cela ayant été une très bonne expérience). Par contre, aucune modification sur les points de compétences et leurs gains ne sera effectuée. Concernant la manière de nous rejoindre, elle reste la même : nous préférons un premier contact sur discord (en vocal ou par écrit, comme vous le sentez ;)). Et de la même manière, notre recherche s'axe toujours vers des joueurs prêt à s'investir et mâture ! L'ouverture du serveur jeu aura lieu entre mardi 20 et mercredi 21 mars. En attendant c'est avec plaisir que nous accueillerons ceux prêts à tenter une nouvelle aventure ! Soyez également avisé que le serveur est stable, rarement en panne et si c'est le cas, la réactivité des modérateurs permet de le récupérer très rapidement. L'expérience de jeu est donc assurée ! Actuellement nous sommes complet !
A bientôt pour la prochaine ouverture ! A bientôt !"

Slow and Steady - New Cooperation & trade server !
Opening Friday 16th, 20:00 (gmt+1). Reduced skill gain (0,4x) (but actions grant SP, to encourage physical exercise).
For players (experienced or newcomers) who want a place to focus on specialization, efficiency, and cooperation between players, and who want to pursue mid/long term goals ! (the meteor is only a midgame objective...). A more creative experience, I suppose. No admin intervention (unless needed because of a bug ?), no reset. The only rules are to be polite and decent with other people, and to avoid resource wasting when possible (cutting an entire forest to make 500 hewn logs with efficiency lv.0 is not acceptable, and can doom the world if others do it too !).
The map is 140x140 (2 km², so basically 4x the default map). IP and password will be released on this discord: https://discord.gg/pUDKB6C
Server is a rented one (located in western europe).

je me permet de poster ce message afin de présenter mon serveur ECO. Le serveur est un serveur nitrado donc dédié, il a été ouvert il y a 4 jours.
Pour le moment nous sommes 3-4 dessus et on se connait tous IRL du coup aucune prise de tête.
Moyenne d'age actuelle : 27 ans. Nous avons plusieurs objectifs dans le jeu, étant débutant nous avons tout à découvrir !
De plus, nous sommes avant tout des bâtisseurs. Pour ce qui est des règles du serveur, rien de bien compliqué actuellement.
Nous souhaitons développer une petite économie, une monnaie etc.
Pour le moment tout reste à faire !
Les seules règles sont la bonne humeur et le respect de chacun, ainsi qu'une présence minimum journalière.
(voir le discord pour plus d'information) Je pense avoir fait le tour, le reste vous sera communiqué sur le discord si vous êtes intéressé.
Petite précision : personne n'est obligé de jouer avec un micro.
Il sera en revanche nécessaire pour discuter lors du recrutement, après c'est comme bon vous semble.
Le plus important est de participer au jeu et à la vie de la communauté. Alors si vous êtes intéressé, débutant ou expérimenté, vous pouvez nous rejoindre sur notre discord tout neuf :https://discord.gg/ePGFdTx
Le serveur peut accueillir 8 personnes pour le moment, donc nous recherchons 4 joueurs en plus.
Cependant, si l’intérêt est grand et que les gens in game sont motivés, on verra pour augmenter la taille des slots. Voilà j'espère que vous serez nombreux à nous rejoindre débutants comme experts, en attendant je vous souhaite à tous un bon week-end.
Et à bientot sur le jeu ! ;) Le lien du discord : https://discord.gg/ePGFdTx (si personne en vocal, laissez un message dans recrutement ou en mp à quelqu'un de connecté)
Le lien du serveur : transmis sur discord lors de votre intégration à l'équipe."

Après les joueurs sont libres de l'utiliser ou pas et plus tard de créer des nouvelles monnaies (sauf si une loi de monnaie unique votée par la population passe comme dans notre précédente partie) Voici les critères pour nous rejoindre : Le lancement du serveur se fera à 21h mais vous êtes invités à venir discuter avec nous avant sur discord : https://discord.gg/t4vApva

I'm going to be hosting a new server reset within the next 48 hours. We are going to be using x5 Skill Points and 0.75 Specialty Scaling. Join my Discord at any time for direct questions and info: https://discord.gg/TQkV3nM I am based on PST, however; I often play at midnight myself. The reset is likely to hit around this time; sunday night/monday morning is most likely. Though, a reset sunday during the day is not out of the question. I will be focusing heavily on Masonry and Building of structures. My brother is likely going to be the smith, and I have someone who is going to do cooking/farming/hunting. There is also someone who is focusing on wood/carpentry. You can find the server at IP: 45.34.121.77:15516 Its name is ""Bitharne's Community Eco Server"" It's running pretty much 24/7; but currently not reset (will update when reset hits). Thanks for your time. EDIT - The restart will be happening within the hour. So if anyone is interested: please join the discord and/or server and enjoy!"

De plus il se fait des gives et l'avoue comme si c'était normal, volent le métier des autres (un forgeron est déjà partit avant moi avant de ça, alors qu'il était bien investi sur le serveur), en outre il gâche littéralement l’expérience de jeu du serveur à lui tout seul.
Visiblement il y a de plus des tensions entre lui et d'autres admins. Le reste de l'équipe et des joueurs sont au TOP malgré cela, d'ou le fait que ce sois vraiment dommage qu'une seul personne puisse gâcher tout ça. Conclusion : A éviter, malheureusement."

Actuellement, il y a un noyaux de 4-5 personnes sur le serveur démarré depuis 8 jours. Nous cherchons à recommencer l'aventure mais avec un nombre plus important de joueurs (10-15 joueurs environs).
Nous souhaitons la simplicité, la convivialité et surtout beaucoup de fun.
Pour cela nous cherchons des gens sans restrictions mis à part l'age, 20 ans minimum. Il n'y a aucune obligations de temps de jeu, de participation, de présence discord ou quoi que ce soit. Vous faites ce que vous voulez ig sauf du grief, du sabotage, et un respect minimum des recommandations de l'administrateur. Nous souhaitons profiter au maximum des possibilités du jeu (système politique,type de gouvernement,économie et gestion des devises, écologie, etc). Il faudra donc un respect des choix de chacun et un petit peu de rp. Nous ne voulons pas d'un serveur avec une progression trop rapide, il n'y aura aucuns bonus de skillpoints ou quoi que ce soit (peu être qu'on mettra le gain de skillpoint par le craft) afin de maximiser la coopération. Le serveur est hébergé sur un serveur personnel performant avec une très bonne connexion. Nous avons donc un contrôle total sur la machine.

avec un ami nous souhaitons créer un serveur, nous recherchons des joueurs matures et sympathiques, notre serveur comportera une dizaine de slots. La coopération sera primordiale, autrement dit, les personnes souhaitant jouer en solo ne sont pas les bienvenus.

Si cela vous intéresse, je vous invite à venir nous rencontrer sur notre discord: https://discord.gg/Z5ZzvX
Dès que nous atteindrons les 4 joueurs le serveur démarrera. En espérant que vous soyez nombreux mais pas trop car il n'y a que 10 slots.

Is there any hosters here what could maybe shed some light on this, or are they just using some VM preconfiged rig I not really wanting to reply on a windows host or pushing linux to do windows things, I know it can support the game without wine from what I have read. At this point I thinking mostly not hosting wide scale as it would mean a rebuild of my set up at the moment for normal hosting and Minecraft, but it's something I still wanting to research.

game-servers,Eco-RP Server | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1152/eco-rp-server,17146,32,1,WillyMcBride,"Hello all, Eco-RP  is a server based around the concept of role playing: where you do not just play as a player in a server, but as a character with a unique personality that effects the way you interact with other player's characters. The scenario of the server is as follows: A band of pioneers have pushed forward into the unknown with the hopes of finding plentiful game, rich soil, and a stretch of earth with which to call their own. Immediately they realize however that with every tree they cut, with every doe they slaughter, things begin to change. Sacrifice is necessary for their survival, but it is up to them whether they purge the land of every living thing, or live in harmony with them. (Players will be simulating a single large group surviving in a land of endless opportunity, or inevitable destruction) Expectations: Wrap-up So please come and check out the server! If all goes well, and everybody is having a good time, the server will remain public. However, if the server begins getting griefers, it will be a white listed server. Please do not let that turn you off of the server, though! If you enjoy role playing, and also love the game that these fantastic developers are creating for us, come check us out! Eco-RP has awoken from the darkness of time, and is back up and running! Please check out our Steam group for more information Steam Group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/ECO-RP"

game-servers,Help setting up a server | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2926/help-setting-up-a-server,4052,8,5,Wazations,"Hi, I don't know if you have figured this out yet but here are some hints for setting up your own server. If at any point these things don't make sense just let me know and I will do my best to answer. So lets begin: Download a fresh server. From the site. Completely unchanged. Then run it. DON'T change any of the settings yet! ;) When you run your server you should get two windows pop-up. One with a list of ""Initialisations"" and one with various tabs (the one in your picture that I will refer to as ""the window"" from here on in). You will need to go to the network tab in the window and make sure that ""Public"" is set to FALSE. You should also see that your game port and web server ports are set to 3000 and 3001 respectively. These are important as you will need these in-order to port forward. Now that this is done stop running the server and close it down. Now you will need to port forward using the port range 2999-3001. There are many tutorials out there for port forwarding so I won't go into detail here as there is no universal way to do it. (This is the trickiest part of the process so if you get stuck, ask) Once you have port forwarded you will need to google what your ip address is (type ""whats my ip"" into google). It should look like this (roughly): 89.113.167.69 Get whoever is wanting to join the server to ""add server..."" and enter ""89.113.167.69:3000"" (for example). You should now have your very own ""Private server"" that you can play around with the settings for and it wasn't that hard (hopefully). The beauty of this is that if you did decide to make it a public server all you would need to do is change public to true. Hope this was of some help :)"

game-servers,Help setting up a server | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2926/help-setting-up-a-server,4052,8,7,Wazations,"Thanks Unique :) The most likely thing I can see it being is that the port forwarding has not been setup correctly. If you don't know how to get to your routers settings to port forward find the command window (also known as cmd) and type ""ipconfig"" then press enter. You will need to type the ""Default gateway"" into the address bar of any internet browser and find the login details for the router (Usually stuck on the router) in order to port forward. First things first, check that wherever your port forwarding is setup looks similar to this (it will probably look different due to service providers but the area I have scribbled on should look similar. E.g. a game/application name that you have created and the device name or device address):  If it looks the same check that the game/application has the right settings by clicking edit (Mine says ""Add new game or application"" but the edit screen looks the same):  If that still looks right, go to the screen that shows you connected devices and it should show you their internal network IP address. Make sure it matches the IPv4 Address shown on the ipconfig of the computer that is running the server:   If that is still not working come back to me and I'll try going though a few other potential problems :) Good luck and I hope this helps.

It doesn't look like they did it in a ""max amount of skill trees"", its actually in ""Unlock Cap"" that is described as: Players may not have more than this many skills level 1 or above (upgrades don't count towards this total). Which is good, because some trees are very extensive, whereas others are not. along with this, ""AllowUnlearn"" with true/false, and described: If set, players can unlearn skill.
and ""UnlearnRefundRate"" described as: What percent (0-1) will players be refunded from the original cost when unlearning a skill? Defaults to none. I hope this helps with your idea of people picking roles in the community to further people working together. Cheers as always, Wisp"

Thank you, hopefully they implement that in the next update. I have run two servers for the game before and the 1st no one traded as they all had the skills to do whatever they wanted.

Then look for the server in the in game server list, and save it to favorites by clicking the tab on the left of it. If you don't see it try refreshing.

game-servers,[AU] Black Talons | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2677/au-black-talons,2167,7,6,assassin,"Review Hi all i have played on this server for past 5 days it was a great server for low ping and was a good place to start. The major down side to this server is that the admin has no idea how be part of a growing Civilisation, the server was up only for the admin so that he could get ahead reducing his need to work as a team as he was already skilled in base skills. I raise this issue in my first 5 min of being on the server noticing that he had already build a town with multiple buildings for different skills all locked away from others. So i decide to come join his little town to see if i could be a part of the town growing finding a gap in his already skilled set. I also raised issue about the admin caring for the server as i just came from a server frozen for 2 days, admin said that he loved his server and looked after it. So i thought give it a go join even if i am way behind and work to be part of the world as that is the game. The first problem is the admin loves to land grab he had spread out 5000sqm along a whole cost, i get him owning the town but this spread cover all local resources and great space around the buildings. This was not a big block but all different ways out of the town to keep land for himself this would block new users from joining in his civilisation with ease but would have to start there own town away from him. I found a hill side pretty uneven close to town opposite to the spread of his town/land grab and begin evening out the land. After my first 12 hours or so the admin return and started claiming land that i evened out all day in between a small store i set up and a home stead i built. After a few words he left my small amount of land and began land grabbing more land at the other end of town. So after 5days building up skill and setting up a store that would support new players joining the server and kicking off growth with scrolls larger carts supply of mortared stone and wood. The server i notice is having issue with no admin on with in the 18 hours i invested i just had to hope it would fix itself and twice it did. Once i had to get a player/mate of his to contact him to restart (the issue being server freezing stopping crafting and cart movement). which rolled the server back and everything i had done in the past 3 hours was lost. Then today same issue but this time server would not reload the world so i tried other servers to check my connection all went well. Just this server and again no admin to assist so now i had to go on a hunt for an admin to fix the server so i could play on the 5day investment i had made. After a few hours admin got back to my post having a go at me and saying it was my end, like i said i tested my end just this server was displaying this fault. After admin did not listen server started displaying as offline then disappearing from the list and coming back again to only display offline. Again i review my connection and tested other servers all working apart from BLACK TALONS, so i recontacted the admin who again told me it was my issue and to go to another server. Review of this server: Happy Gaming all hope to work with valued players on an great servers"

My name is Valour, a hard enthusiast in sandbox games quite like this and past Co-owner of multiple sandbox servers. Currently I'm in the midst's of creating a dedicated, 24/7 server called Meta-Eco, run with its own website (still in the process of being professionally created) along with a proper discord channel. At the moment however, I have it down for now as I don't plan on opening it until everything's finished and the server is stable and has the mod's I am currently looking for, however my dream is to continuously update this server with state of the art plugins, mods, and UI's, all of which I have experience with, it will just take time. For now however, I'm looking for a team that's interested in running this server with me along with the website/discord channel once it's open. Currently, I'm looking for: For those wondering about the server itself, it will be fully operated from my high end setup and not be relying on any third party, so there should be no issues with connectivity My goal is to get this server functioning in excellent condition for when it launches to the masses, but of course it'll be available hopefully within the next few weeks, so if you're interested, please message me/send me a chat. You can also ask questions about the server here and I'll be happy to answer honestly. I'll create a separate forum for when the server is open.

Some features include:
1.Revamped hunting system with animals acting more realistic gives hunting that extra edge,
2.Butchery tables now give 50% more meat than by cooking it raw in the campfire, not to mention all the extra scraps you get now.
3.Lots of the recipes and skills have been changed to give the game the required length of 190 day meteor, some items require less now like ingots and sand much easier to get now.
4.Storage chests now hold more and all the objects requiring fuel have an extra  slot.
5.Wood carts even though still buggy can now hold the max of 12 stacks not just 5.
6.Tree seeds now drop more often for those who require tons of wood.
Many many more to name like i said were new come by start up a player, and if your are not satisfied just don't play. But its worth a look. The Rock 181.215.47.236:3000  Dedicated server 5.5.4   4Km² map 190 day meteor  200 slots

I've been playing Eco for about 3 days now..
Anytime I think I'm going to like I game I throw up one, or maybe even two servers for it on my network For the past 3 days I've been pretty much by myself, I know there's a shortage of players and an over population of servers but
Let me tell you why you should play on mine. A little bit about the server
-It's a 1x map, so I hope you're ready to work together! :D
-There's no meteor, don't kill the planet ;)
-Usually I'm pretty lax about server rules, I'm not uptight, I don't care about profanity or vulgar behaviour, don't get me wrong griefing is not okay, but idgaf about what you say in chat. I don't have a list of rules yet, but you should get the general idea. ;) So, what'a ya say?
Lets be friends :D

game-servers,How to set map size ? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2511/how-to-set-map-size,9665,3,2,rentechd,"There is no configuration in game for 'max players'.  This is usually controlled by the server. As for the world size:  In the worldgenerator.eco at the to you will see dimensions listed.. the default is 100X100.  You can change this to make the world bigger (or smaller).  The dimensions must be an even number or the world generation will crash in most cases.  140X140 is a 2X world, 172X172 is a 3X world and 200X200 is a 4X world.  In alpha its not recommended to exceed a 4X world.  The large a world the longer it takes to generate the world completely - up to an hour on large world depending on CPU available. Edit:  Meta has confirmed that there is a bug with world dimensions and recommends building worlds in 100X100, 140X140 or 200X200 (default, 2X and 4X)"

You can also leave a comment in there telling people what you are looking for. Another place to look up servers is at ecoservers.io.

game-servers,Liberalist's Hideout goes public | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2255/liberalist-s-hideout-goes-public,1167,1,1,voyagebass,"Hi everyone, are you looking for a server to play on? Currently on our server we are 2 guys being quite self sufficient i.e. we can do the things we need on our own but as you can imagine at a not so perfect cost. That's why we are looking for other players to join so we can build an efficient society where everyone can build his dream. The story so far: I began playing on a German speaking server where I met 3 English speaking guys and we had a lot of fun forming a little community and helping each other out. Only thing was the conversation with the other players sometimes forced me to translate. And I had no possiblity to help others in antagonizing the bugs in game e.g. replacing a disappeared cart. So I decided to rent a server and take the English speaking guys with me which worked out quite well in the beginning. So we started to build a little town, each one with his own property and a plan in mind in what trade to specialize in eventually. Being such a small number of people requires you to find the right balance between specialization and generalization so it was kinda tricky to please everyone as one of the guys strictly headed into carpentry without being able to care for a minimum of food for himself. You can imagine the consequence: He didn't come to a reasonable amount of skill point gain, felt being treated unfair until he rage quit two days ago with a second guy leaving shortly after for thinking that we are not enough people to be able to create something useful. I think he also had other personal reasons I don't dive into here. So there are only two people left and it begins to get boring. Why did I tell you this story? Because it's a good example of what not to expect. Heavy specialization (in the meaning of having no clue about other things than the profession one chooses) imho is only a good thing in a society big enough to ensure that the gap caused by the lack of generalizaion WILL be (not only can be) closed by others. When I take a look at other servers that prevent or disallow you to skill another profession than your chosen one then I feel quite restricted. I don't like that. If the community is big enough and people have a minimum of intelligence specializations will evolve naturally. The more people there are the smaller will be the niches one can specialize in. If e.g. there's no provisioner at all to offer good food for a reasonable amount of whatever I can specialize in Campfire Cooking, Campfire Creations, Baking, Culinary Arts and maybe even Agriculture and Milling. If there's a farmer, I may omit Agriculture and trade my needed ingredients for food I make of them. If there's a cook good at Campfire Creations making a lot of Wild Stew I can specialize even further into Baking to complement the Wild Stew with Baked Meat and Camas Bulb Bake (which in combination of 1:1:1 gives a steady 145.5 points per day, see my other post linked below). For the Baked Meat I'll need a good deal with a hunter. And so on. Finding this balance imho is the crucial part of this game that makes it so interesting. Of course it is easier to find the balance if the community has a strong leader that cares for it but this comes at the cost of reduced freedom. That's why I called the server ""Liberalist's Hideout"", to make clear that each one is self responsible. For that to succeed every single community member needs an understanding of the game and it's mechanics. You are looking for something you can't do on your own or don't want to wait for the skill points that will allow you to do it? First: Have a look at the Economy Viewer. Second: If you don't find it there ask the community. If no one is able or willing to help you, you'll have to wait for your skill points. But if you can offer something useful to the one who's able to do the job you're looking for, he (given he's intelligent too) will trade this for that. So the rules on the server break down quite simple: If you can live with the mentioned rules and are not frightened by them feel free to join:
138.201.200.232:3061
The server's located in Germany and (as you can surely tell from what I wrote) I'm not a native English speaker but to be understood by everyony we stick to the common language. Current status (19 Apr): To give you a good start, there'll be skill scrolls and beginner's food available for a resonable price. You don't need to build a Research Table. But you may of course. To better understand game mechanics please read my other posts:http://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2245/eco-hidden-featureshttp://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2244/best-food-combos-for-different-skill-levels-in-5-5-4 Hope I didn't scare you :)

We'd like to invite you all to join us for the opening of our modded community-driven server: SMC ECO! Our goal is to create a unique ECO experience through a combination of community events, role-playing options and mods, which all promote interaction and intra-dependence. Amongst other things, we've shaken up the skill tree to introduce professions and added a guild for each profession. Multiple professions are available to people - for an increasing amount of skill points - but you'll need to work together to master everything in the game. This will (hopefully!) lead to a truly multiplayer server in which everyone can contribute to a greater whole. If you're interested you can find out more via our site below:Welcome to SMC ECO.Differences from Vanilla. How to Join:
Simply sign up to the website above and you'll be added to the whitelist :) When's it Starting?

IP: 95.154.229.150:3021 About us!
This is a new dedicated 24/7 ""Modded"" server recently wiped for update 5.5.1 on 21/03/2017. We are currently looking for new players who may be interested in joining the server. Our current players are a very friendly bunch who welcome both new and experienced players. If you are new and have questions or need help, don't hesitate to ask. This server is not whitelisted meaning you can join on your own and do not require any form of approval. This server is high ram, high priority and low lag with us focusing on this server being accessible throughout the EU & US. Have you played on another server and encountered issues? been kicked? facing errors? Well. Our server's main goal is to be hassle free, convenient to the player,  and have multiple easily accessible help and support options available. As ECO is still in Alpha, it faces countless errors forcing players to be kicked and unable to reconnect to specific servers ex, our server has custom fix's that an admin can do for you. Disconnected and unable to reconnect? Facing the 100% loading error bug? ...Just drop a post on this forum thread or drop a message in our discord chat and your issue will be fixed swiftly and promptly. We pride ourselves in being accessible to help and support players with technical errors, or just in game help/support. With minimal downtime, the server is always accessible to you so you don't need to worry about the server going offline and you not being able to play. You can see for yourself our online status Here. You can join our discord (if you want to) Here.  This is optional and totally up to you, although we recommend it. Server Mods
The server has several modifications offering new commands to players not offered in vanilla servers. All our server mods are true to the game and do not affect core gameplay. We try to keep the game as true to its nature as possible making players still need to earn and collect items legit. Our mods are purely for convenience and bug fixing. We're working alongside @ClayC to update, test and create new mods. As mods that fit our server's values are updated to 5.5 or created, we will add them to the server. We hope to see you on the server!"

Its been longer then 18days, remember after a round server get reset. My motivation for shutting it down is that the server is not needed enough.
The amount of people on the server is very low, there is not very much interaction on discord between the players,
The voting is not being used so we wont get new people on the server.
The majority of the player base dont appreciate the amount of work and cost that goes into it.
The server is to expensive to let it run for a few people.
So yea, if people helped more to keep the server alive i would have put more effort into keeping it up. There is a high chance the eco server will continue on the main server of rg community,
Server will get a new ip address, and new staff to operate and maintain it. The reason 21 March is chosen is for a good reason, 0.5.5 update is planned to be released today so people can have a new start on the new rg community server or another great server from the public or private list, this way the wont lose any progress the made as today is going to be update day.

So the first time you run the server, it will generate the world. WAIT for it to finish. Read the GUI carefully. If you try to choose REGENERATE to make a new world, it will crash. And you will not be able to use that server again. You will be forced to unzip a new server copy and start all over again. The Devs need to fix it and I have reported it several times over the past few versions, but they never have fixed it yet. So just giving you this message now to save you any kind of headache."

i understand this can be easy in some ways but, its very limited compared to a rented vps.
and for those who understand how to setup a eco server on there own home pc here is a example. Im not posting this to advertize but to give a example hope its ok, Game Host:
Good: Instant setup, Support, easy to use. Cost example: Low performancehttps://pingperfect.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=1
Location: Germany.
Ram: 2gb
Cpu Priority: None
Cost: 9,68 Euro Cost example: High Performancehttps://pingperfect.com/cart.php?a=confproduct&i=1
Location: Germany.
Ram: 8gb
Cpu Priority: Extreme
Cost: 61,28 Euro As you can see for a basic Eco server its afordable, but if you want room to expand your server, to have it run lagfree cpu priority is important as with most host you share multiple cpu's with others in some cases it runs realy smooth but its a risk as in many cases you share with to many other user. VPS Host
Good: Full Control, High performance, Cost example: Low performancehttps://contabo.com/?show=configurator&vserver_id=193
Location: Germany.
Ram: 12gb
Cpu Priority: 4 cores dedicated
Cost: 13,98 Euro Cost example: High Performancehttps://contabo.com/?show=configurator&vserver_id=180
Location: Germany.
Ram: 50gb
Cpu Priority: 10 cores dedicated
Cost: 50,98 Euro High performance is overkill for 1 server, you can run multile game servers on it, but im just giving this as a example for those who know how to run a eco server, that there are many options out there from game host as wel as vps host, Hope this info can be of help to some of you,

Justin from Singularity Hosting has been kind enough to basically donate some ECO servers to the community.  I received access to one and i would like to  share with anyone who was having as much trouble connecting , staying connected ,, and having a fit when the server im playing on goes down for hours.
So the one i received is open no whitelist ,stock size ( i think it can be made larger on the fly but i have no idea ), no meteor ( 300 days out anyways ) and no laws yet. Bullying and belittling in chat will get you removed as i think this game is about working together ( if i hear one person suggesting to keep skills from new players cuz they will ruin the world,  i will loose my .... ,,, jus sayin).  i just want to share with everyone the great server that SingularityHosting.com donated to us :)
For the few days i been playing on it ,,(once i figured out how to use RDP lol ) the server has not gone down once. The ping for me is 100 or so depending time of day, i am west coast and i believe the server is central US. I have had no hiccups at all ,, ( no loosing connection , no loosing sync, no idle messages in the middle of doing something, and the server has never gone down without me telling it to.  ) Server IS listed in the server manager.

BACKGROUND (Yawn) Thanks for taking the time to read this post.  Myself and a friend have setup a server in the UK.  We started a server is because we love the game and tired of servers resetting without warning.  We aim to communicate server wipes when possible.  We will be keeping the server up to date.  If we have to wipe for updates then Skills and Resources may be spawned in for all players. COMMUNITY We are looking for other mature players to come and play.  We are open to all types of players.  If you want to play solo and trade that is cool with us.  If you want to start a town then you will have to register this interest to us.  Depending on the skills you unlock you may be invited to the town we are creating. HOW TO JOIN Server IP 88.150.145.79:3021 Or look for UK OldGits Server Discord https://discord.gg/RJsQyG3 Websitehttp://oldgit.enjin.com Hope to see you in game.

But I'm not sure how well I could host for you. I'm in east US. Not sure how well server runs at any distance, let alone half across the globe. Again, welcome, and best of luck."

If you can stand having the computer that has the terminal screen on 24/7, or just long enough to reboot once a day when the server does to keep the session open. Yes, it is a waste of power but, it works. Also, you can use ""Screen"" on Ubuntu Server to hold SSH sessions active, allowing you to actually close the program on the computer without ""closing the session"".  Once the ""Screen"" program is installed on your server, use it in this fashion instead of the ""nohup"" command :
"" screen mono EcoServer.exe -nogui ""      -     This is how I have my server running...  Seems stable! How do I know?  I am actually running a headless linux server as well, setup in the aforementioned style. Seems fairly stable! Can't reveal my  system specs though ;) That's the secret to stability, honestly... Only down side?  Unable to use the server's GUI to edit on the fly. You have to be willing to edit the server scripts manually, which can be a bit unnerving....

It is rather labor intensive AND requires ""burning"" one key for the headless server. It somewhat requires a minute or two of downtime, depending on how quickly you can navigate all of the GUI on your Windows PC. This is the ""method"": 1 - Take your server offline which forces a backup. RIP the files down from your FTP that save your world (I know which ones these are through ""deduction""...  ) 2 - You can edit the files on your Windows PC as an ""offline"" server, using the gui to edit the files... 3 -  Transfer said files from Step one BACK ONTO the server  (sounding like Garth on Waynes' World) 4 - STARTUP server with the ""screen mono EcoServer.exe -nogui"" command. This is how my system is currently setup....   And I am no genius ;) Just read a LOT of other peoples stuff, and compiled this workaround. Hope this is helpful!!

I'm Freds00n and currently playing on an active server with two smaller cities emerging. Our main community has about 8ish people in it, everyone with their own home. Our city is called Pairi Daiza (server Pairi Daeza) and i'm currently the head chef of the island ahem mountain. That's why i've build a restaurant to sort of have the feeling of entering a food business. A second city is emerging as well with 3~ people in it, also connecting to them. As far as i know this server is one of the bigger ones with sometimes up to 10+ people online and also seeing members coming back. Everyone kind of has his/her own job but as we get into higher tiers things start mixing up but we're still dividing tasks! I'm trying to keep RP in the game and buy as much stuff from others as i can without doing it myself so i know what you're going for. Only problem might be that you're from the other side of the world while the server is hosted in the Netherlands. We do have someone from Texas playing and if things go wrong we can contact the admin via discord. Unfortunately the server seems to be offline / unstable for now so i'm not able to play myself but i hope once that clears up we can all play together again and give you more information. :) &Yeah communities aren't too big yet but people tend to leave quite fast and i'm not sure why.

game-servers,Amount of English speaking players? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1309/amount-of-english-speaking-players,1119,3,1,crimsonBZD,"Hi, I'm a prospective supporter of ECO, I'm familiar with Alpha titles and what that means, and am really interested by what the game seems to be overall as well as the constant Facebook ads on my wall. However, I've come to understand from my research that the number of US servers is highly limited - I'm wondering overall  how active the game is among English speakers at all, it doesn't seem like a moderate ping would kill the game. I understand there is an official server, however they seem to be very far along - then again on that note I'd assume you'd need to find a server that is just starting up or that has just reset itself for some reason to get in on building something from the ground up. Any info anyone might have on this would be greatly appreciated, I just don't want to end up buying the game only to not really have anywhere to play and ultimately meh'ing out on it, it looks very very good."

I'd like to invite you to be on my ECO team. It's my understanding that this game is geared towards classrooms. Since that's the case, it makes sense for the game to be tested by a group of people who are in agreement to work together and all start off on the same server. I'm looking for some people who would be willing to communicate through this forum or email as we engage in an ECO game. I would like to be able to start a server knowing that I have a list of people who are ready and willing to jump on board and contribute to that particular server. If you say yes, I will never get on your case if you don't contribute in world. I have a busy life and know what it's like to not get on my computer for a week. ECO can be pretty slow without a team of people at least communicating about what they're working on though. It would be nice if I had even two or three other people on my server that had told me what they're working on so I can work on something else when I have the chance to get on.
I'm really laid back, just thought I'd see if there's anyone else also looking for a more consistent team.

Like I told Mid above, I've also hit a super busy part of my life, so  I am not even sure how much time I have to dedicate to the game atm. Thank you all for your replies as well. This has been an extremely friendly community thus far and hopefully, life giving me a chance, I'll have the opportunity to play with some of you. ^^"

game-servers,Au Public Server | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/987/au-public-server,3749,10,4,Flirtle,"One additional thing you can do is check to see if your ports are open when the server is running. There are many websites that you can use to see if your ports are open, here is one of them: http://www.canyouseeme.org/ The default ports required for Eco are 2999, 3000, 3001.
So check those to see if they are open."
game-servers,Au Public Server | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/987/au-public-server,3749,10,5,NoBlackThunder,might not work with routers like my that have protection against port scanning

Another thing you could do is on the computer the server is running from, you could check on the resource monitor (Depends on the windows version you are running) Here is a picture of an example (Mine may not be configured correctly but it is just an example) It shows you if the port is 'listening', and what the windows firewall status is.
Of course, if you use 3rd party firewall technologies, you will have to ensure these are set up correctly."

So far you can't control the server very much, unable to set up scenarios. It's a fantastic game and will be a great learning/teaching tool when it's fully released! But you would have to talk to the developers and see how long they think it will be before it would be usable in a classroom environment. Edit I think I saw an expected timeline somewhere, with beta testing starting next year and full release over a year away? It's got a bit of work to be done :)"

With that in mind I can possibly come up with a build that matches some learning goals, create some simulation that matches the goals as well as the amount of students involved and the time frame they have to spend on it.

Eco's systems are still relatively unbalanced so 7 days between resets sound pretty good for alpha. The server should keep 10 alive of each species.

We as group would like to challenge the community in several new environments. We believe that Eco will be an amazing playground for several social and game play experiments. So beyond the normal game play we would love to add a twist every week/month depending on Meteor cycle. Upcoming Theme - Mint baby Mint (Alpha 0.2)It would be amazing to see more animals/mineral being mined due to currency value, can we make coins have a specific effect on the ecosystem? Or better yet, will we see people specialize to gain the most income from their profession? Upcoming themes Staff
Currently we are also looking for staff to assist in our projects. Are you willing to help us develop and create a better server experience for everyone? Send me a message on these forums or worldofeco.net/forum . Whitelist
At the start of Alpha 0.2 we will not be running a white list. However for specific themes/plans we might we want to limit the server population. Would you like to be sure you are able to get in? Apply here or on our forums  Whitelist application

Both I and the other administrator completely support any bridging between educational video games (or video games in general) with school education. If you like, please message me directly via private message with when you would like to have your students come on and the amount of students in your class. Look forward to hearing from you! :D"

To fully test the new features of the new build and re-find any new bugs, we will be reverting the server to default states. This means no boosted skills or unlocks. However, you will still be able to craft chests in the Saw Mill and there will still be grief tracking on the server. We will be analyzing the impact of Alpha 2 on our other mods before reintroducing them. Sadly during testing, Alpha 2 was not very kind to the existing map and so a fresh map is probably required. I will attempt once more to rescue the map with this release version of Alpha 2 before wiping it. In addition, PlayECO is moving the server to more powerful hardware. The server address will update to connect will be the same but I will post a backup connect hostname once the move is completed."

This group is linked by survival and coop kind of games. We run several game servers (Ark, Rust, 7 Days to die) on a dedicated server and we already planned to run a Eco server as well as soon as the alpha is released. This dedicated server is paid by the community members through a donate system. It is running from 10 months now and we hope a long life for it. :-) We are not hundreds of people but the core is still strong enough ;-)
I heard about the games some weeks ago and Ifound here a real great concept behind this idea. I used all my lobbying power to get my community to host a server for Eco ;-)
We are mostly (if not fully :P) french people but don't worry, you will be welcome both at forum and Teamspeak server.
Again, I see here a great concept and hours of fun (and less fun :P) to cooperate with others people and make the world surviving us. :-)"

During the alpha stage of the game we currently do not have any ""over arching"" rules for the world, we will allow the players to work together and see what they come up with.

I'm a dev tier backer and I have been testing some pre-alpha server builds on our server so we'll hopefully be able to have the server up and running right at the alpha launch. To give you a little more information about us here's a quote from our front page:
The goal with this community is to provide a fun and mature dedicated server for like-minded people who would like to collaborate (and probably argue with each other a bit now and then) and work together in this upcoming ecocentric survival game. We will be aiming for a light roleplaying approach where the players are encouraged to play the game in a way that they would find viable for their in-game character. Which means that the main focus will not be to “beat the game” or trying to abuse different game mechanics. Instead we will focus on a fun and dynamic way of playing where people are encouraged to create interesting in-game characters with individual goals and opinions. Though we will need to see what the game will look like before anything can be planned in detail.

I can't seem to get it work. Is there a config file or something I have to setup to allow my username to log into it?

I can't seem to rotate my character. Is there a mouse-look modifier button? Tried in both windowed and full screen, can't seem to rotate my character or look up/down. Also, my resolution doesn't seem to be an option. I'm on 2560x1080 on an Ultrawide. Is that something we'll see supported in the future?"

Please feel free to add info and Ill update the thread. At this point lets assume there is a separate executable for server hosting, and that it doesnt have a gui, instead requiring a text file for configuration. • Server name
• Port to be used
• Player slots
• Admin whitelist
• Admin password
• MOTD Port forwarding is something we usually need to do so • Ports required
• How to port forward Firewalls could be a potential snag • Allowing apps through windows firewall Most community servers will want a TeamSpeak (TS) server also • Short Win guide
• Ports required for forwarding
• Linux guide?
• Moderation?"
