community-help,How to Do a Clean update with Eco Client and retain a Saved Solo game | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3270/how-to-do-a-clean-update-with-eco-client-and-retain-a-saved-solo-game,1649,1,1,rentechd,"If you have not played a solo game or have no desire to retain the one you have played, simply deleting the files in your ECO folder and unzipping the new ones you downloaded back in there is all you need to do. If you have been playing a solo game and wish to retain the game take these steps before deleting the files in your ECO Directory. 1.Go to your ECO directory and in Eco_Data folder locate the Server folder and click to open it and locate the storage directory and open it.  In there is your saved world, by the name you gave it and .eco.  Copy it to a safe temporary directory somewhere outside your ECO directory.
2.  Now go to the Config Directory and save the Network.eco, and Users.eco and any other config file that you may have edited.  Copy them to a safe place.
3.  Delete all the file in your ECO directory
4. Unzip and put all the new ECO files back in the ECO directory
5. Get world save files and copy then back into Eco_Data/Server/Storage
6.  Go to your Config directory and open each of the files that you saved copies of and make sure you copy all the edits you made before into the new config files (in most cases these do not change so you could just copy them back in but if something has change it will break you load or you will not get a new setting in - especially if they make world balance changes for solo, so best to always manually edit your configs) Once you have done this your good to start your client and go back to your solo game.  It may take a bit longer to load the first time after an update as it has to be converted to the update."
community-help,How to do a Clean Server Install for New Update | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3008/how-to-do-a-clean-server-install-for-new-update,3778,1,1,rentechd,"Updating your server is very easy with a  few steps and you can do it without any risk of losing your saved world.  In most cases updates are compatible with the previous saved games.  NOTE:  Starting with 7.2 your saved files are now Game.eco and Game.db and you need to save both  If you are more then one release away you must update through teh releases so your world can migrate to the final release you want to be on. ..The devs work very hard to make it so saved games migrate to the next version.  Unless told otherwise you should not have a problem with a saved game and a new update.  If something special has to be done to migrate a world for an update they will tell you that in the update announcement and you should follow anything special they tell you needs to be done before doing these steps.  These are just the general steps to use for straight forward updates. First you will want to save your backups and your saved world as well as your configuration files.  These are all in your  Storage/ and Configs/ folders.  Make  make a backup of these folders and contents away from your server root directory. Then delete all the Eco server files and install the ones from the new update. Copy the Storage folder back in to the root folder  so that it copies back your backups and your Game.eco  and Archive,eco (world save files).  Since the new update will have already made a Storage folder it will should ask you if you want to replace the new one with the old one you saved (that contains you world files).  Tell it yes.  Don't delete that copy you made just yet, until you are sure you have no issues and no longer need the backups or files in your copy.  UPDATE for7.2 and forward:  There are now .db files in the Storage folder you will also want to save/backup and replace.  You now save Game.eco and Game.db The last thing to deal with is your Configuration files.  The two most frequently changed configuration files are EcoSim.eco ( the simulation config) and the WorldGenerator.eco file.  So do not copy your old copies of these files back into the config folder.  This way  your game will for certainly have the most updated version of these files.  If you had modded these files for your previous world you will need to go in the new copies and apply the same edits.  For example if you built a 2X world instead of the default dimensions you will need to go into the new WorldGenerator.eco and change the dimensions to 140X140 like you had then in the previous version.  If you changed TimeOfDay or plant growth rates or something like that in EcoSim.eco you will need to go apply those changes in the new files. For other configuration files, like Backups, Disasters, Difficulty, Users, Network, Modkit, Rooms, WorldObjects, World and so on, in most cases you can just copy the ones you already had edited with your settings back in.  Its always wise to make a quick check and compare your old version with the latest to see that they are the same and its okay to continue using them  If there has been a change then use the new version and edit it with your information/settings so it works with your server. You server should now be updated and you can just start the server!.  Sometimes there are migration steps a world has to go through when there is an update the first time it loads.  Don't worry if the first time you load the server after an update it takes longer then normal to load.  It only has to go through the migration pass one time - after that first time normal load times should resume. Occasionally, when a world is migrating through an update it will crash.  Very often it will recover from the crash and then load up, complete the migration and be fine.  Its always worth letting it have a retry if it crashes when migrating the first time.  However, if you keep having issues you should back off and stop your server and seek advice.  This does not happen often and in most cases there is an easy remedy.  This is one reason for holding on to your backup folders and files until you know for sure everything is working.  This way if the devs need to see a fresh copy that has not been migrated yet you will have that for them."

This was my only issue so far with Eco so I decided to take some time and see what/if any information was out there to assist me in this. Turns out it's really simple to setup and host on. Things you will need to do: Follow this links instruction to install the latest version of MONO.Link You only need to complete steps 1 and 2 (nothing else) Once that is done you should run this command. The output should say Version is 5.4+ if everything went right. Now to get the server files and start setting up your server... And that's it boys and girls, If all went ok you should now be waiting for your server to build on your linux box.
I'll be making some interesting things for myself with managing the server but may post them here if others would like. KNOWN BUGS: If your like me and learn from watching videos on YouTube, Your in luck!Simple setup tutorial"

Never was keen on manually stopping processes nor have I done it much in the past. The main problem I have is the dedibox is currently hosting live servers, shutting it down completely would require alot of announcements and notification to players that the service will be unavailable for a time, thats something I want to avoid.
This is what I meant really in regards to native linux support, we need a proper administration interface and/or documentation on what command lines are available to be able to manage the server properly."

Also the build time is 50% slower on Linux vs windows so after you see finished you have to wait for building chunks to finish. Depending on world size this can take up to an hour.

there are several examples listed above on how to use wget or do a man wget

a directory. do the following: adduser eco
su eco
cd You must be root when you are doing this
This will add the a user called eco and then change to that new account
that you just created and then take you to the home directory for eco which
should be /home/eco The process of getting an eco server setup on Debian was really easy. I do have

dirty script I use to start my eco server Once you create it remember to chmod 700 start-server.sh I call it start-server.sh #/bin/sh
mono EcoServer.exe -nogui & I made a script to run to find the process ID to be able to kill the server once you recreate this file remember to chmod 700 find-server.sh I call this find-server.sh #/bin/bash
ps -aef | grep -v grep | grep 'EcoServer.exe' | awk '{print $2}' That is all it is.. what it will do is print out the PID of the process for your EcoServer.exe
very short and dirty but it works well for me on Debian.  If it doesn't return anything that means
the server is not running. Another issue I found was that how do you get access to the admin commands running the server on Linux The first thing you need is your steam64id or slgid To get the slgid go to https://ecoauth.strangeloopgames.com/home And log into your account the slgid will be called your User ID: it will look something like this
slg666666 I do not know how to get the steam id since I am not a steam user sorry. Now I found a really good guide on how to setup your server so it
recognizes you as an admin the guide is at https://pingperfect.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?f=97&t=1467 you have to go into the Configs directory and edit the Users.eco file
go down to where it says Admins Now my config file looks something like this my ID
has been changed here in this example If you have to add two people all you do is add a comma for example ""slg666666"", ""slg666667"" This is an example for Beta 7.2.5 that I am using ""Admins"": {
""$id"": ""4"",
""System.String"": {
""$type"": ""System.Collections.Generic.List`1[[System.String, mscorlib]], m$
""$values"": [
""slg666666""

community-help,Eco Network Troubleshooting guide | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1150/eco-network-troubleshooting-guide,7660,1,1,NoBlackThunder,"Eco Network Troubleshooting guide  First of all this document is meant as an addition to the server guide here http://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/88/how-to-set-up-eco-server-quick-guide-work-in-progress-guide I will also refer several times to the image above here, Several computers , phones etc are numbered from 1 to 6. I will refer to these numbers. The map above is help to visualize where we are on the network. Hosting a private server just for your self requires to add eco server to the windows firewall while public or private servers that other players outside of your home should have access to require also configuration to your router. Since routers have different configuration methods and pages I wont cover those but I will give an example on standard ASUS routers that are very simple. You need to google how to forward ports for your own router! -Setting up the firewall on your server (1) !!! 3rd party AntiViruses software or firewall might still block ports even if you open them!!!
Please configure those software or disable them if needed! To get your server configured you need to open some ports before you can start the Eco Server. You can find your firewall options in your control panel ( on newer version of windows you can just hit the windows button and search right away for the firewall application) When opening the  Advanced Firewall settings you are med with a screen that has allot of rules from before. Please select the “Inbound Rules” and click the “New Rule…” button.  This will open a wizard. Here you should select that the new rule should be a port rule (Selecting Program might later cause issues when updating the server!) On the next screen you should select TCP and give the rule a specific port range. A ""from - to"" range can be set with help of the “-“ sign. This means if you like to open port 2999,3000 and 3001 you should write 2999 – 3001 (reference image below)  On the next screen you select what to do with these ports. Here you should let the default “Allow the connection” stay and click to the next screen.  For the next screen let all items remain checked ( All of them should be selected by default!)  Finally you need you need to name your rule. Good naming practice now, will make it much easier to find the correct rule later; should you need to make adjustments.  Forwarding your router ports (4) To give other people access to your server you need to tell your router how to handle incoming request from certain port that come from an external computer like a friend that is living in another town (6).  On an Asus router you can find these settings under Wan -> Virtual Server / Port Forwarding.
( I censored my own setup to keep my server secure but this should give some idea).
First of all you need to set a name (Service name ) . The next item is the port range, on my router I would write 3000:3001 to give it the right range .
Next item is the local IP. This should be your server iIP (1) my IP would be 192.168.0.60.
The next thing is the Local port, normally this should be blank.
The last item is what protocol.. Right now we only need TCP since eco does not use UDP.
To save these configurations I need to hit the + sign and then save the configuration. Troubleshooting Normally if you did the above as described you should now have a server that people could access. If not, you need to troubleshoot to find out where the issue is. •	Check if your server is running properly.
On your server(1) open your browser and type Localhost:3001 If your unable to see the your eco server site you might need to start the server as an administrator. Other possible issue can also be an outdated .net installation. Its recommended to have at least .net 4.6.2 or higher !, you can download .net 4.6.2 from here https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=53344 •	Repeat the same thing but from a different computer (2) or phone (3) that is connected via cable or WiFi to the same local network. You will need to write the server address this time in your local browser instead of local host. In our case I would write 192.168.0.60:3001. If you are unable to see the eco server status page you have not opened your local firewall. Remember that external antiviruses like AVG , Kaspersky etc running on your computer that host the Eco server might still block your ports. Disabling or uninstalling would be the simplest solution here. Another cause could also be that you have not configurated the right ports. (in future you might also need to open UDP ports instead only TCP ports ). •	So far so good. most likely your local network is now working properly but other people can't still see your server. First of all check if you can access the server page again.  For this you need a device(5) or computer(6) that is not connected to your local network. You also need to know your external IP address. You can find your external  IP address by visiting this site from any device or computer on your local network (1),(2) or (3). You can find your external / public IP here https://www.google.no/search?q=whats+my+ip&oq=whats+&aqs=chrome.0.69i59j69i57j0l4.1063j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8 . I should try to connect via my external phone(5) or computer (6) with the web browser to the address 77.77.77.56:3001. If I am able to connect but I cant see the server in the server browser you might have forgotten to set your server in the server configuration to public. This can be done via the Eco Server GUI under Network/Config/ServerIsPublic set to true. If you are unable to access the eco server status site from an external Device (5),(6) you have most likely miss configurated your router and need to reconfigure or restart your router. There is not allot more to this actually .. in most cases it is this simple.
If you have additional questions or issues please search and post on the forums and if your issue is still unresolved or send a message to Eco Support at support@strangeloopgames.com"

Right now i am using a non feature complete pre alpha version, and your version might be very different. i will try to keep this post updated. it seems there is a build missing ExportedMods folder in the mods folder .. this might create issue when joining a world not loading for the client .. manual creating it might fix the issue When you opened all the ports in your router and firewall you can proceed to start the server exe.
You can go here and check how to portforward your router portforward.com
You will be then meet with a console status window ( don't close this one or your server shuts down)  if you are meet with the error message on start up as shown above you server has insufficient rights and cant host the web ui.
you can easily fix that by running the server as Administrator.  After the initial core has loaded you will get a second window. Her you can configure your server and can see the status of your server.
It will take some time for the world to generate. after this window has loaded. but you can follow the progress here.  Under the tab World Generator you can change world size, seed and many other options on how your world will be generated. You can easily regenerate your world by going to ""World"" menu and regenerate the world ( This will not affect players and other placed objects like doors) or you can also stop the server and delete the content in your ""storage"" folder that is with your server folder.  The UserManager Window tab lets you set a white list or blacklist users by there name. Update!!! There is a new setting under network / config called Public server. You need to set this value to true if you want your alpha 4 ++ server shown in the server browser Update2 If you have slow loading time ( serialization taking several minutes after 75% ) you can try to update .net this should resolve the issue https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2015/11/30/net-framework-4-6-1-is-now-available/ Update3 i added a new post with specifics on setting up the network part http://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1150/eco-network-troubleshooting-guide hope this small quick guide helps to set up your first server.

community-help,How to set up eco server / Quick Guide (Work in progress Guide!) | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/88/how-to-set-up-eco-server-quick-guide-work-in-progress-guide,113258,74,11,SirusDaggani,"@arakash  There is typically two levels of firewall you need to clear. First, you have your router (Unless direct connected). This needs to have the firewall configured properly as well as port forwarding to so that requests to your IP address know where to forward the information to the proper port and Local Area Address. Second, you will most likely have software on your personal device that is hosting (As you mentioned, windows firewall). Depending on what is used, options may vary here. For my security suite, I have to add the program as trusted in and outbound, port permissions for the ports just like I did for port forward, and a few other tweaks. For typical home users, I doubt you will encounter additional security (Like a built in hardware firewall on your host device too). Either way, I experience the same issue with hosting. I can access the server on a LAN address locally, but I cannot manage to get the server to communicate through WAN. I don't have any issues with other servers I hosted, so a vital step is missing somewhere in this guide (Which is why i originally asked if it was TCP, UDP, or TCP/UDP) . I gave up trying to figure out why no one on WAN can see the server, even through a direct connect attempt since I assumed maybe the master list was not updating with my server data."

I was not successful in making myself in game admin.  I didn't try to hard though cause I'm not trying to use any commands anyway. You could always give yourself some good food possibly to get points rolling in fast without giving yourself 10k points maybe. If you figure it out let me know!

But yes you have to forward through your router if you want people outside your home to see the server and that will remain on the server.  Servers that require posts for connection will need ports and they will need to be forwarded.  This will be a permanent requirement

I get that air pollution causes ground pollution, but can the height of your output pipes reduce this?? If not why not? We seem to be getting a hall of ALOT more ground pollution than air, which is strange as we're using the Blast Furnace and Cement Kiln, and not on tailing producing recipes, it also takes a lot longer for ground pollution to clear and it seems to spread faster. However there is someone else on the server I play that uses the Blast furnace and another that uses the cement Kiln, and they are often using these machines yet there seems to be little to no air or ground pollution coming from these...
One thing that might be pertinent is that they are in a desert Biome, does this reduce the amount of ground pollution transfer from the air? If someone understands how this works then please explain it as I'm having a hard time trying to figure out my pollution levels vs others... I'm also max level for smelting so it's not like i'm inefficient and using them for longer... Thanks in Advance."

I have players who cannot connect externally.
When using a webbased port checker, port 3001 is listed as open and the server's web panel works.
However, port 3000, the default game server port is listed closed when scanned by a UDP web based port scanner. I have Avira running on this dedicated machine, but it has no firewall of its own.
Current and intended setup includes This configuration (despite port 3000 being deemed closed) has sometimes allowed brief connections that always timeout. Here's my extensive troubleshooting
I tried to prove that my ISP isn't blocking ports. This configuration included.. Results showed that I cleared all firewall and NAT entries and tried this in reverse Results this time were similar. I've also tried running an instance of an older game's server that uses UDP. The scanner showed that port to be open.
My ISP doesn't appear to be blocking UDP. I asked my ISP to assist me with this issue. We went through the process of resetting both my ONT device (used with fiber connections) and my modem router.
After reconfiguring everything back to the intended setup, I received the following error code when connecting.. Network config entries I have include.. ""PublicServer"": true,

I rented a server from PingPerfect less than a week ago, a few friends from previous games joined me and we had a bunch of new people, it had been going well for the 6/7 days it's been online. I launched the game today and I got instantly kicked out with the message:You were prevented from playing on this server. This message is presented to any other user that's trying to get in. I've checked on the PingPerfect control panel, and can't see anything to suggest that the server has been compromised from the control panel, the whitelists and blacklists are empty and the configuration files seem untampered with. However, logging on to the law page you can see something is not right. There are elections and laws that never took place, these supposedly ended 14/8/7 days ago, the server has only been online for less than a week. The player b0tha was a genuine player and was elected a few days after the server starting, certainly not 14 days, the two players who seem to be random new users and who are part of the weird laws and fake elections are ElijahEvo and Muffin I've located their steam profileshttps://steamcommunity.com/id/ASexyMuffinhttps://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198879767788 Unfortunately we will have to start the server fresh as I wasn't setting regular backups, at least that's something I'm aware of now. I am wanting to report these two players, and I am also hoping someone knows more about this than me because I really don't know what an earth is going on but if these two players are abusing some systems or using third party tools then the relevant parties should be notified. To recap, server has barely been operational for 7 days, overnight, all users are disallowed access to server, there are elections that have taken place and laws passed over 8/14 days ago and two previously unknown players seem culpable.

I'm currently trying to farm now i'm all settled... Aaand it's complicated. (I'm pretty sure i'm not the first to complaint about this). There's way too many numbers and god knows how much numbers and I aren't friends.
I did understood moisture and temperature is quite important but when I go to the place where the plants could grow it's really not helpful ... You literally have scan every bits of land without grass to know whether this could be your perfect match! And i don't want to waste my time doing that.
Is there any  other way to enhance the quality of soil? I'm guessing fertilizers could the trick but which? I do know however it all depends on the plant you want to grow
How do you guys farm? Thanks a lot! PS: I've already made other searches and they're very outdated so i wouldn't really trust everything there."
community-help,How to farm efficiently? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5184/how-to-farm-efficiently,150,2,2,RomenX,"@Serane155 I suggest using the filters on the mini map for the producing areas for the crops you wish to grow. Plants have different requirements for moisture and temperature, and it isn't possible to have just one farm to grow all types of plants because of this. Use the land claim tool to highlight the 5x5 areas as the soil conditions are supposed to be the same for all tiles in the 5x5. The existence of wild plants growing in an area is also some indication of what will grow there, though it may not be the ideal conditions for those plants. The soil sampler you make in the farmers table will help you determine what the conditions are for any given tile, so you can analyze the soil under the grass or plant to see what the conditions are and how well it grows there. This works for trees as well."

Put the pumps at a water source, with the wind turbines, with the pipes reach the Blast Furnace, connect the exit to the Waste, which must have near the coal power generator, and put pipes to create the drain, place the stockpile so that it is seen by the Waste, supply both the Blast and the generator with coal, and away with the production .....

community-help,Blast furnace | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5302/blast-furnace,253,3,3,RomenX,"@Borazlak For things with 2 fluid pipe connectors the output is apparently always the one with the little valve on it. So connect the output (valve) side of the water pump(s) to the input (non-valve) side of the blast furnace. Run a pipe from the water pump input to a water source (river, lake, ocean). Then run a pipe from the output of blast furnace to the waste filter if you have one (otherwise you can dump the waste somewhere, but it will create pollution). The output of the waste filter is clean water which you could pipe back into the clean water side of the blast furnace or just dump it somewhere). Water pumps require mechanical energy from a windmill or waterwheel while the waste filter requires electrical energy from a steam generator (which has to be within 10 blocks of the waste filter).

Now, my problem in this is: Tailings. Somehow, I don't seem to be able to stop them from polluting the Area. I dug 30 Blocks deep to create a 7x7x7 space in solid rock. I then lined all walls with mortared stone and placed a stockpile in the remaining 5x5x5 space to store the tailings. Three days later, my plants start dying... I searched the wiki, and it says, Tailings immediately pollute the entire vertical line of blocks where they are placed. Then the pollution spreads horizontally and they will basically continue to pollute indefinitely. Only the rate of pollution-spread can be influenced by wheather or not the tailings are contained. But for this, it makes no difference wheather I bury them in stone or simply cover them with dirt... In earlier versions, I would have simply made the blast furnace, since it only pollutes air (which resets in time). But now it also produces tailings. So...here's my question:
I need to make Iron to destroy the Asteroid. So I HAVE TO produce tailings. But If I have no means to contain the Tailings, and their pollution-spread will go on forever... what's the point? Can I ""win"" this game?

I opened the map and searched for an area with bright white salmon population. I could even see the animated fish swimming around. So I throw my fishing pole out and stare at it for a solid 4-6 minutes. Nothing. I repeated this for quite some time, but didn't catch a single fish. Are there fishing baits I didn't see? Also cooking.
Now, every time i do something, I don't have the specialty for, I see that yellow arrow with a red cross through it. I chose campfire cooking as my first specialty, so I see it quite often. BUT... I don't get any XP from cooking either.
I cooked 10 Tomatoes, 10 Beets and three Rabbits. But I didn't get a single progress-point in Campfire Cooking, even though I chose it as my specialty."

I find that usually I have to get the bucket directly over the bed of the truck before I get the green outline indicating to unload (right click).  I'm not sure, but orienting the bucket so it actually looks like it's dumping over the truck might make it easier to get the outline. BTW, if you're digging near the building that needs the resources, you can just select the excavator as a linked stockpile and it will pull whatever it needs out of your bucket automatically.  Handy if you build your smelters directly near the iron mine."

Also this is how I been told it works it does a check every time the app is open rather then cashing, this came from your member of staff on discord. Maybe it will work logging in then going offline but this isn't helpful when there is no internet connection at all so I haven't tired it that way as it's not useable in a offline setup. So what I did was, start up the server, and it was already set not to be public, that's fine, then I logged in to the app and it showed it in the server list. I closed game only not the server and disabled the internet and relaoded and the game is asking me to login again, this is the newist update and I am on windows 10 ent 1607 I have only tested this like I said on the normal version, but another problem is I have the normal none steam version and the wife has the steam version so I not sure how we would do that also. I believe it should create a session that is per computer rather then per login but I am not the creators of the game and the reason they picked per open the game is a loss to me, having a user having to send login data is also not the best idea but still, in the dev's eyes I know nothing. How did you do the no internet connection test, did you login the disconnect or what?  I be willing to test little more but same time I don't see this option in the game nor seeinging it working that way."

community-help,ECO Server - Steam - stackoverflowexception | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4852/eco-server-steam-stackoverflowexception,357,2,1,Valkeller,Hi Been playing for around 3 days on a server i host and yesterday it went down due to a stackoverflow but I could restart the server with no issue. Last night it went down with the same reason again and now I'm unable to start it. It goes thru the entire process but after finishing the Server initialization it ends with a stackoverflow. EDIT: After a lot of fiddeling around I uninstalled the server program and deleted all folders to it and then reinstalled and added the latest back up which seems to have fixed the issue.

There is an issue with some of the smaller crafting items showing 0s for craft time and thus won't craft at all. The craft screen shows NaN for craft time. This happens with pitch, hewn lumber in the carpenter station and a couple of other recipes so far. What I have tried:
1)Restart game
2)Restart computer
3)Remove crafting station and place again
4)Remove building and place again as well as crafting station
5)Put crafting station in different building
6)Make a new station and put in new building Results: Nothing has worked so far.
Any suggestions would be great."

community-help,Extremely Low FPS if some Buildings are built in one area | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4737/extremely-low-fps-if-some-buildings-are-built-in-one-area,599,3,1,Mr.FreshDachs,"Hey guys,
whenever there are some buildings built in a certain area (not tooo much, but quite a bit, a small village, like 20 chests, 20 tables..... in about 5 houses) the game is getting extremely low FPS in that certain area. From normally 100-200 FPS it drops to only 7-10! Graphic settings won't affect anything at all. As soon as we leave the area and the buildings dissapear from the render distance, the frames are coming back...
All of our 5 players expierence the same problems, so we are pretty sure it should be a server issue...
We rented a server on a Hosting-Company (GPortal, if anyone cares), but first we tried to host an own server on an own (seperate) PC, which caused the same problem after our town reached a certain size. (Wich is why we bought a server for more perfomance, only to get the same issue again :( )
It may be worth mentioning, that the server only has about 80% CPU usage when starting and then it won't ever use more than about 3%. So i thought, maybe the so called ""WorldTickCPUMax"" setting is bottlenecking the perfomance (currently on 0.1). It won't let me change this setting from side of the server company appereantly (support already contacted) but on my own PC-server it changed nothing at all......
Has anyone the slightest idea what to do about that? What are the dozens of servers with HUUUUUUGEEEE metropols, monuments and vehicles doing, what we are missing? I can't imagine that these guys are playing with constantly 5 FPS :D ;) Thanks for your help guys ;)"

You now use your gameport instead of webport to connect, so if you used to connect to port 3001, you would now use 3000 if you used default ports. If creating a standalone server on a machine with the client-server already installed through the game, you have to use ports other than the default, perhaps 4000 and 4001, although you always use 2999 as the listening port and share with the client.  You may have to check out your support pages for your ISP to learn about your router or google your router make and model for a manual to read information about port forwarding.  Usually, your ISP support site will have information on port forwarding for your modem/router. If the router is not from your ISP or they do not have that information for you, there are many guides online about how to do this, and it is a relatively easy process. Next important thing:  If your server's not showing up, you need to go into appdata/LocalLow/Strange Loop Games/ and delete the Eco folder then restart Eco and it will write new files.  To get it to populated you may need to open the filter (middle button between search and refresh) and click 'apply'. Also, 'validate files' via Steam for the game and make sure your graphic card drivers are up-to-date. Let me know if you're still having problems."

I opened the ports 2999-3001 at my router and firewall. antivirus software is also disabled. Also I checked the ecoserver for the ports and like you said it is 3000 for gameport an 3001 for webport.

second! this is due to incompatible mods with server version, if you run CTK (ClayC's ToolKit) this will be due to using a pre 7.4.4 released ctk version, here's how to fix it!
with your backup completely update everything to 7.4.5 and then download ClayC's latest toolkit update! which is for 7.4.4 but works fine with 7.4.5! if the problem is still not resolved it may be due to another mod, but we had alot of people with this issue and it has soon been fixed due to the newest updates!"

of course I can tell my antiovirus to shutdown, thats not the issue. First of, Im a person that dont think you should disable security features like firewalls and antivirus. Its better to understand whats need to be done to prevent issues becouse of security measures. In this case we have a internally made website where the serverbrowser is getting http://IP/info and one of the servers of many if flagged as an issue.

community-help,Antivirus detects Infection | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4538/antivirus-detects-infection,778,7,4,ShaydenMac,"We don't believe that shutting down an AV program is the best thing to do either, however, we have no control over the programs of other developers. Eco and EcoServer are checked for viruses throughout development and prior to release, test negative for viruses with the major AV programs. For those programs that have not yet changed their viral signatures to know that Eco is safe, our hands are tied. If you are getting 'positives' on certain selected servers then this could be caused by mods they may have installed that your AV program has an issue with but we cannot control what a user modifies in the game once it's in their hands. If this is happening with a server then I would suggest you look for servers to play on that your AV software does not have issues with and perhaps ask the server owner what mods they're using and perhaps talk to the modders as well. Early on, when Eco was first released, most AV programs had 'false positives' but players contacted their AV software developer about the issue and they updated their software so that it would not have these issues. Perhaps you should try contacting your AV software developer and provide them with the report you are getting and they will tell you what they need from you in order to clear this up in their program. This is what was done during the first few days by players and almost all AV software developers fixed their signature files to not falsely say that Eco had a virus.    Eco cannot re-develop just to work around one AV program. AV program developers know that they have to adjust and re-write signatures for new software and they do it all the time. When you contact them they may ask you for a copy of the Eco.exe or the Exoserver.exe and you can certainly provide that to them. I hope this helps and that you get Eco up and running soon! Please let me know if you run into any more issues."

I own an Eco server hosted at nitrado. It runs for several days now but got a little buggy today, with players glitching through blocks etc. Thus I wanted to restart the server to see if that fixes the glitches. But I found that the server does not create the Game.db and Game.eco files in the ""Storage"" directory nor does it create backups of these files in ""Storage/Backup"" (the server is configured to do that every 4 hours). Is it save to restart the server or will our game state be lost? Where does the server keep the current game state, just in memory? If it matters, I had to shutdown the server at the start and rename the existing Game.db and Game.eco files to __Game.db and __Game.eco, because that was the only way to force the server to generate a new world with our modified settings (nitrado does not offer a function to force world recreation). It seems that since the server was started after renaming those files, they never got recreated. World creation worked just fine, we are playing on that world for several days now."

The math formula is X5=Y Where X is how many of the object it takes to stack one block high, and Y is Max amount in the stockpile allow. Seeing that Dirt can stack one to make one high, 15=5. The reasons behind this is cuz the stockpile is 5X5X5 so nothing should really stack higher than 5 High. You will find some objects like mortared stone will stack 15(cuz it takes 3 to make it one block high) while stone takes 4 to stack up one high, why it is allowed to go up to 20 As a modder, there is yet a way to remove this math formula from the game without editing the master source...

Either you have not a single free space in inventory and backpack or you should contact #support on Discord or SLG support.
'Cause without space you don't get the scroll and without the scroll you can't learn the skill.

I was looking forward to coming back a day later with all the new skillpoints to spend, but when I came back, time hadn't passed in game and no skill points were earned.
I realized I needed to set up a server to have the ""persistent world"" and I did that (by downloading and running Eco server on steam), but it just generated a new world. I tried deleting the files for the world that was created for the server, and copying over my Eco world files into the Eco_server World folder, but it won't accept them; When I boot up the server, it ignores the copied files and just generates a new world again. In short. I just want to generate skillpoints without having to keep the game running, and without losing the progress I've already made. Is there some small thing I'm doing wrong thats preventing me from turning my solo world into a persistent server, or is this some Non-compatibility problem where a world that started out as a ""Non-server"" game cant be converted into a server game?"

The guys answering there have done more tests and know more than I do especially when it's about various setups.
You can start your private server with [SteamPath]\Eco\Eco_Data\Server\EcoServer.exe, too. When you start Eco that's what happens when you create or join your own private world in background.
To change your Configs you can do that or use Chat >> /openserverui where you can change various settings.
Unless you wanna play with all the settings and try to learn by doing I suggest to ask in #server as you'll probably get a fast and precise answer."

First thing, apologize my english. I try to understand (almost) every line in the file ""worldgenerator.eco"".
I can't find anything about it on the forum.
Is there already a documentation everywhere ? if yes : where is it ? For example, in the generation of the plateau, I've made some tests, but it's a long work because I need to create a new world each time and the modifications are not so obvious.
Here my actual setting (for Plateau) :
""Plateau"": {
""$id"": ""5"",
""CliffStopsBeingSheerAtAngle"": 5.0,
""CliffSheernessStartInterpolate"": 1.5,
""MinPlateauHeight"": -0.1,
""CliffChance"": 0.0001,
""RadiusRange"": {
""min"": 28.0,
""max"": 32.0
},
""SlopeRange"": {
""min"": 0.0,
""max"": 0.5
},
""RadiusNoiseFreq"": 0.9,
""SplitPercentHeight"": 0.9,
""StartSplittingAtRadiusPercent"": 0.9,
""MinHeightToCarveUndercut"": 2.0,
""OverhangChance"": 0.9,
""MarkWithBlockType"": {}
} I can say (but I'm not sure) that
""RadiusRange"": {
""min"": 28.0,
""max"": 32.0
}
set the diameter of the plateau
but I can't find how to set the height max.
It was just for the example, but I'm sure we could create a world like we want if we could understand all this file.
Make more plain and/or create mountains not just hills. Or make less or more ocean on the globe. (for this I already have modified the water level and height [of the world] but it's not ""nice"", I get more sand and ""desert"" zone, but where the water is supposed to be I can't get tree or hills or plains...)

community-help,Is there a shared ban list? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4183/is-there-a-shared-ban-list,907,4,2,Thineboot,"In a world with only benevolent admins that would be perfect. Unfortunately admins are also human...
Therefore you would need two lists. And bad people can flag good people, too... Eco tracks nearly everything in-game. So SLG could use these data... but wait, have we signed up for Big Brother and do we wanna end up in 1984?
There's the reputation system in each world. Why not combine these data. Hmm, well, trolls would never ever abuse this system, right?
Ok, here's the golden cow for SLG: pay SLG to run their own overwatched servers with paid admins 24/7. They would have to interview each applicant, train them, send players in their worlds to evaluate their work, ..., hey, unemployment solved as long as players could afford the costs. Laws should serve your good cause and lower the damage bad people could do within a short time. A reasonable way could be to establish some basic laws in addition to Citizenship to encourage new players to get in contact with other players. Like limiting the damage you could do to a world by griefing without proper consent. We'll see what SLG and the community will come up with, what's good, what's bad. I doubt a blacklist will show up at the top. Even with good intentions it could do more harm than you might expect in the first place. Just give it a thought or two."
community-help,Is there a shared ban list? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4183/is-there-a-shared-ban-list,907,4,3,Karellen,"Putting aside the ""realism"" aspect (simulation of social interactions) and focusing in on banning players within a game perhaps this can still be possible, provided there is a suitable process in place. In order for a ""bad"" person to flag a ""good"" person the good person would still need to login to a bad persons server, and then be banned.  Perhaps the servers which contribute to a global ban list are authenticated servers (perhaps SLG approved or similar).  These become ""save servers"" where players are less likely to be trolled (since the trolls have greater risk associated with their activities there). In addition to this we could have a system where after the player is flagged a number of times on different authenticated servers they oly then receive a global lock-out ban (since it appears the same players re-offend on multiple servers). The bad players I'm trying to target are those that work in groups to run military-style operations, who work out the fastest way to make tailings and distribute them throughout the game world - they go from server to server, doing the same thing.  This seems to be a troll trend that has formed. Personally, I think SLG is rather light on punishment for players.  There seem to be no visible code of conduct,  guidelines or rules in place and instead place most of the responsibility on servers external to them.  They need to think more like Valve."

Once the ECO server was online, any attempts to connect to the server failed, but the console did display this error message: ""Disconnecting Client [reason: inactivity] ... Unknown client inactive for longer than 30 seconds etc etc etc"" (See screenshot). If I looked on the config form (Network -> Display) I could see that the authentication user name was empty (See screenshot). After about 30 minutes of letting both the server and client run in the backround, I was finally able to see my server show up in game under favorites, but not under the server browser. I told my brother that the server was finally online (lives in a different house than I), but he was un-able to connect via ""Add Server"". I'm not exactly sure what the issue can be, but I know its not my VPS causing the problems. I have windows firewall completly disabled and I verified that ports 2999-3001 are open via an website that checks ports. Hopefully this post can give the devs some clues about the possible problems with people connecting to servers. EDIT: After removing the server from my favorites, I am again unable to connect to my server when re-adding it back into favorites. It just shows offline all the time now. I am able to connect to the world map in my remote browser just fine."

The GameServer is on port 3000 (default), and the WebServer on port 3001 (default). In order for my brother and I to connect to the server, we have to click ""Add Server"" in game, and type the IPAddress on Port 3001 (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx:3001, the Webserver address). Im not sure that this is intended behavior, but it finally allows us to see the server status in the server browser correctly, and connect to the server without issues. If we then try and connect to the GameServer on the correct port (3000), again we cannot connect and play, and the server shows a disconnect after 30 seconds like before. The server still does not show up in the server browser when not favorited however, and i can't seem to figure out what that is, since it can be connected to via direct IP."

We're seeing, for example, urchins that produce raw fish, and not urchin meat, which we're told is what's supposed to happen in 7.2/7.2.1. We've compared some of the cs files (EcoSim, for example) between our hosted server and someone's local install of the Eco server, and they do not match. The hosted server's boot console reports 7.2.1, but these files are not the same. Since we are hosted with a third party, we're limited to working with just the MOD and CS files, but not the server core (dlls and exes) without getting the host to intervene on our behalf. We were told that we need to have the Eco.Mod.DLL deleted so the Steam updater could make necessary changes, but if that's one file we need to nuke, are there others?

I am new to Eco and am currently setting up servers and server hosting solutions for the game. I am already excited to be part of the community but I have run into a few issues. My Main goal is to be able to pull log information and live stats via php to display on a website.
I have identified the log locations in the ""archive"" game.eco but the issue is that php is unable to select from the .eco file format
thus not allowing log and other information to be pulled live. I am aware that this file can be extracted manually and then used as a txt format to pull via php but this is obviously not live nor is it
viable for a hosting platform. To summarize:
I am wanting/looking for a way to have all files for the server saved outside of the archive format and stored in the storage folder as such:
Storage/Chat/Data.*
or
Storage/Server/errorlog.* I am also aware of the built in website structure that is being worked on as well but I am in need of direct live data from the server.
I have seen the compression Option within the settings and Will attempt to see if this is already a feature that i can turn off so that the files are saved as I have explained above. Tho the list is extensive and shows two options for none. Thank you for the support on this. Thank you,
Panic. Update: I have attempted setting the compression level to both selections for None and no success, still archives files. :("

If you set up a server, I assume  it's to play the game in the matter it was meant to be  played. Thus you remove players that don't follow that. You don't limit them, you simply get rid of them. Now, stealing in my opinion is not a thing. Put things on your property and it cannot be ""stolen""/taken. Put it unprotected and I will assume it's community items. Blatantly removing everything from the chest on the other hand is bad. But lets say you find an unlocked chest and you need a couple of seeds.. I'd take some, then return later to give back. Thing is, do not give admins item spawning powers.. Either allow a player to play, or remove the player.>
Too many servers in too many games give benefits to people who either donate, pay or are friends/clanmembers.. That's blatantly wrong.. Same opportunity for all players, including admin. Being the one paying for the server should NOT make you king. If you have a public server then you already acknowledged that other people will be playing.. Whitelist/lock it if you want something else. Most players in most games will be happy to donate a $1 or two for a good stable server to play on. In my opinion it's better for an admin to be open about costs of running the servers, and maybe have a dedicated paypal for the server so players can see what their money is going to. I dont want my donated $ to go to an admin buying new games or other shit.. It's for the server, and the server only."

We can't judge any person we can't say how a new user will be till it's two late, not all server admins want to run a server like you so yes these optins are needed, this also helps a admin set up a server or home hub before going public, and it helps create the game play to how the server owner wants, Eco states you can have the game played the way you want it well we need these powers for server owners."

Like I have said before all the above you have stated have been tested and MY tests have made it clear there is a fault with the game not converting the domain to a IP to connect to how ever it handles the address, I tested this by using IP over domain many times and ever time in our case this has been the fault NOT the port or firewall, I know this is most peoples mistakes but I am not a first timer when it comes to hosting and games. The game also fully showed up on lan for all our local users, but not our remote users, when we changed the way we talked to the server via the address only it worked, but this is not a 100% problem it only happens now and then where it just does not view a domain as address and states the game is offline, even tho everything is online and the web ui and everything is fully acceable and the server is pinging fine. How do i know it's not a fire wall or port problem, well lets see, when testing we disabled firewalls, even after fully letting the app open on them ports, we DMZ'ed the server, we even had people test via DMZ on there local set up as we have people whom are able to disable full port and firewall options. Can you now explain to me why I wouldn't be able to check if it's the port of firewall ? can you explain to me why you would even think someone is unable to do these kinds of things, Also explain to me why you feel when I say there are problems you know the answer and keep telling where to start when I already done this?"

But I only found this all out myself by tested and hunting for files to see if it was doing it's job since the server list never showed it up even after a few refresh's but then later on it would pop in, so we needed a better way to test this. So this is why the Continue Tool is useful for me lol. But Ya in the client if we use the domain at times it does not work, then it does, but the domain always pings fine, and no problems at all after this, even after with all clients and networking things restarted it all still worked and remote users are able to connect, it just seems sometimes the client spits at the domain, I can't see what's happening at this point.

SpecialtyCostMultiplier - The multiplier applied to the cost of obtaining a specialty from a tech tree. SkillGainMultiplier - The multiplier applied to the daily exp gain rate. The higher this is, the more skill points you will get to assign within a given time. SkillPointsPerAction - This is how many skill points you are granted for performing an action, like cutting a tree, placing a block (I believe this is correct) SkillPointPerCrafttime - This is how many skill points you are granted after completing a build project based on it's duration in seconds.

The mod Pam also says things like no user is willing to test when someone ask for support,  I find this god dam rude, I also asked for links and information about hosting and the rules of hosting as I am thinking about setting up a host for the game, there are some changes needed to be done or see if it's already out to see if it can be controlled by php, but I been told I am not OK to host the game for him because I have to put the files on the server for him, I do offer people web hosting on another platform what is Linux I have my network already set up for ftp and other things to that box, and it would be a piss take for the files to be sent from that host to the windows box and since there is no remote control panel for him he asks me to change things. I find this person very rude, I also had some faults others had when setting up his server, so I explained what I have done to get it working, and Pam replied to me refuering I was wrong, I bloody did it so how the hell am I wrong, I also gave back support to others, and then I told I not aloud support and kicked from the dam server.

We have a normal size house and some stock piles. The first day we didn't do any hunting. Still at a quick rate everything was going down.

We are still new to the game so we don't know much.
Since everything was going down quick I started hunting for Bison. Then I noticed that bison's kept growing instead of  going down.
(We started with 59 -> I killed 40 -> In 1 hour -> 68 bison's .) Please advice.

When it comes to 'Carried' items such as Stone/Dirt/Sand/Etc you can only carry ONE at a time (initially). I'd recommend you get a Workbench up. Craft a small wooden cart there (https://eco.gamepedia.com/Small_Wood_Cart). This will allow you to 'dump' your dirt/etc into the cart (up to its WEIGHT limit). You can then haul the cart back to your town/house and place the items into a Stockpile (https://eco.gamepedia.com/Stockpile). Inventories link to nearby crafting stations/other inventories, so I recommend you place your chests/stockpile close to your crafting tables. Use your tool on the cart (or open it manually and drag to your CARRIED slot) to move the items into a stockpile. Carrier items cannot be placed into a chest, only in a stockpile or back into the world (stacking items outside your house without a stockpile also works but the storage wont link to your crafting this way). Hope this helps!"

I am getting disconnected every few minutes from my own lan server, with no message, it simply kicks me back to the main screen and the server just says ""player has left"". Any idea what might be causing this? Second problem, when I log back in, any loose items such as felled trees or chopped logs are floating skyward. I know we are supposed to throw resources at beating the meteor, but I dont think this is exactly what that means. I've seen this happen before in other games but unsure of how to fix it. Lastly (for now anyway) I am running server 0.7.0.5 beta, and my friend is running the same client, yet my server shows in the list as incompatible to them and will not allow them to join even by IP. I have made no mods or changes to server settings."

In order to play the game single player, you also have to download and run the Eco server. You can find the server in the same place as the client download: ecoauth.strangeloopgames.com Once the server is up and running (could take a while as MW said), launch the game client and it will show up in the server browser. Just make sure the client and server are the same version or they will be incompatible. Hope this helps!"

With help from NoBlackThunder, i have decided to write a guide on running multiple servers on a VPS for the steam release! This Guide Does NOT Cover Staging Releases! All commands in this post are required to be typed! So here it goes, Step 1
Firstly, you will need to own a copy of eco, you can find the server files in ""tools"" in your steam library, install this to have access to basic server files, Step 2
next you will need SteamCMD which can be downloaded here: https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/client/installer/steamcmd.zip Step 3
Create a folder for cmd to be installed into and place the steamcmd.exe file in this folder and run.
next use this command ""login username"" to enter your login details, you will be prompted for a password to your account, if you have steamgaurd it will ask you for your TwoFactor Authentication, i recommend not having it as it will make updating the server files through this a little tedious. Step 4
once it is installed create a new folder in the C:/ drive call it whatever you would like this is for your second/third/forth server EG. EcoServer Step 5
next run this command in steamCMD: force_install_dir C:\ecoserver this will make your directory,
next run this command as posted, you will have to type all commands as CTRL+V does not work: app_update 739590 validate
this will install the new ecoserver files, you can do this for multiple servers but you must repeat this step everytime! Step 6
Create a new text document and paste this script into it.
""// update <-- name of this script
//
@ShutdownOnFailedCommand 1 //set to 0 if updating multiple servers at once
@NoPromptForPassword 1
login inputusernamehere inputpasswordhere
app_update 739590 validate
quit"" save the Text Document with an easy to remember name! EG. Update
Note! this is the update script to update your server files as new ones are released! if you have SteamGaurd it will ask you every time for your TwoFactor Authentication Code, Step 7 Run SteamCMD and Type in: ""runscript update.txt"" this will run your update script, Re-do Step 7 every time there is a new update for the server files! Your server is now installed! you can find all the server files as normal in your chosen directory! you will also see a steamapps folder in there the first time you do this but thats fine you can delete it to no harm :) i hope this is easy to follow! please let me know if you are having troubles!"

They were contacted some time ago with tips on how to resolve this issue for their clients but apparently the issues have bot been resolved.  The problem they have is that each time the server is started it creates and builds a new world and often is subject to crash loops.  This is not due to Eco or anything wrong with Eco and nothing that can be done by you or by the Eco devs to resolve it. this is a fix Nitrado has to perform. In most cases the work around has been that users have changed providers

You can tax players to create tailings (which nobody will like), but allocate them money for placing those tailings in specific zones or containers. An example would be taxing the players 1 credit for creating the tailing in the first place, but allocate them 1 credit for putting that tailing in a specific area specified in the law you proposed. Or you could opt to not tax them for creating the tailings and pay them to drop it off in a place of your choosing but this will require another way to keep the treasury funded whereas taxing them and giving them an easy way to get their money back would give them initiative to actually move the tailings where you want them."

Keep in mind these laws are new on not well tested so I am not sure how this in going to work for new players that join the server. Also we are doing it with a global currency  that we created called the EOG Dollar. First we charge a deposit for harvesting the two tree types of 1 EOG. This then gets put into the treasury. Then we refund .25 for each pulp picked up. This then gets taken back out of the treasury. I have found that this amount is going to be too high for the average amount of pulp created per tree. I wish I could modify the law but all it looks like you can do is delete the law and create a new one.

Mine typically sits around 4GB RAM but having about 14GB available after the OS and other processes grab what they need, I would say you will do just fine on 8GB using a 64-bit version so a 32-bit version should be OK with even 4GB. I can't tell you for sure what FPS you'll be getting, there's allot of things that factor in to that like your CPU + GPU and what resolution you run the game on. Typically the lower the resolution, the more strain is put on your CPU than your GPU. Raising the resolution may actually yield higher frame rates assuming your GPU can handle it but for 1080p gaming, I would recommend a solid GPU to begin with. I'm running on a Ryzen 5 1500X + RX 470 and at 1080p on ""simple"" settings, it tends to hover around 130-145FPS. On ""good"" settings it's about 90-105FPS. I haven't tested any higher or lower settings yet but CPU/GPU utilization tends to sit around 30-45%/55-70% respectively on the ""good"" settings. Hope this gave you an idea of where to start when you have a target frame rate in mind. Also keep in mind, that minimap will play a huge role in your FPS. Depending on the level of detail and how far in your zoomed, it can drastically drop your frame rates instantly. On the ""simple"" settings, maxed minimap details and about 75% zoom took me from 130FPS all the way down to 10. Yeah, it's that drastic, so to improve frame rates on the fly try cutting down on the minimap details and keep it zoomed to around 50% or so."

The thing is that cores and clock speed do not reflect the actual speed. Like a  core i5 can with ease outperform a amd 8 core that has higher clock speed. here is an example of it . slightly lower clock speed and only 4 cores against your 8 core cpu http://cpuboss.com/cpus/Intel-Core-i5-4670K-vs-AMD-FX-8320 the intel cpu is massively outperforming the amd cpu .

If your friend is running a more updated version of his MoBo BIOS it may be having an effect on CPU performance overall. Now this may not be the problem and some PC users find updating a BIOS to be a little on the risky side considering if you do mess it up, it can indeed brick your MoBo. An easier solution i find to be the cause of very low frame rates quite often is your GPU or graphics card drivers. I don't understand why, when a newer version of GPU drivers is released for a specific graphics card, your frame rates usually drop in allot of the games that were running just fine the day before other than the possibility of drivers manufacturers releasing said drivers the same day or a couple days after a major update to popular games or OS updates. It doesn't sound like that's the problem but it never hurts to check for an updated driver. One last thing I can think of that may be causing this is overheating. You won't notice something like that right away and task manager simply can't tell you, but if you are indeed overheating and your CPU is thermal throttling, it will affect performance tremendously giving a 6 core piledriver CPU a huge advantage over an 8-core. In the end, looking at the graph, the pattern of utilization tells a somewhat different story tho. The short peaks of 90+% utilization with frequent drops to 25-30% tell me there may indeed a problem with your MoBo BIOS not being the latest version. Next time you boot your PC, hop in the BIOS and check the version and compare that to the latest version from your MoBo manufacturers website. On the bright side though, it's probably not a GPU problem considering 1080p gaming places more load on the CPU rather than the GPU which I find ironic since 4k gaming places almost all of the load on the GPU letting you hit 60FPS with a rather low end CPU and high end GPU whereas 1080p you will need a stronger CPU to keep the same 60FPS."

First of all as i stated we tested it before . and it is sadly not working right now. all we can is wait for ether mono to fix there bugs or for .net core catching up . Pam is also a community moderator. That means that she is a normal player / backer that got a moderator group to try to help people and keep conversation nice between people. Though there is always a high chance what she says might be wrong. On top of that i wonder what admin did you message ? You did not message me and i am the person to go for. If you message one of the other devs then there is a high chance that the message can get drown in loots of other messages or forgotten if they where busy. Now it is just sadly like that from time to time that this happens because most of the devs are when they are available they are working on the game and if they see a question they might put that on hold instead of taking a break from coding / fixing thinks.  Even i can send John a message and he forgets about it, and metachronism can oversee even more messages when he is working. There is no intentional ignoring really it is just like that sadly when people are deep into something. they might click quick over it to see if its important ( North korea lunching nukes ??? nope ok then it can wait a bit) and then just sadly gets forgotten. They cant instantly reply or remember everything, the game would never get done with all people sending pm's . If you pm /dm me on discord you will always get a reply ( mostly quite fast sometimes it can take up to 12 hours if i am asleep) Anyway! Sadly we are a bit hard locked on multi os support when it comes to server since Mono is not supporting features like they should. There are work around's but sadly there are still mono specific bugs that make the server very unstable :( . It did work all originally with mono, and some older version might maybe even start ( you need to use the -nogui command) but i personally would never recommend it from feedback i have gotten so far. So for now all we can do is wait"

We had that conversation quite some time ago, not today.  What I told you was that ECO was not officially supported for Linux but that although some had it running back on version 3 there was a break with Mono which was causing issues.  The problem was not so much ECO or native Linux but that Mono had some issues with .Net and Mono was not addressing the issues.  I explained at the time that devs had even tried rolling back a .Net version in the hopes that that would work around the Mono issues but it did not seem to fix the problem as users were still reporting the same error.  I also explained that the official support of Linux would not be coming until after (not upon) the release of ,Net Core 2.0 so that ECO could run natively on Linux.  the reason I was 'on about Windows' is that it is what was supported at the time we had no other solution to offer but Windows.  I also explained at the time that when .Net Core 2.0 released, while MS said it should be 100% backwards compatible there was always the case that some change to the ECO code might be necessary for it to utilize .Net Core 2.0 and run natively on Linux and that the devs would have to also test a solution before Linux could be officially supported, and that would include setting up Linux servers of their own for testing, as well setting up what release Linux support would come out in so to please not expect immediate Linux support as soon as .Net 2.0 was released, that like everything else when it came to changes that affect the code its never an overnight thing and the devs would have to make the call on how and when support would come. We had a follow up conversation after Meta had said they thought that there was now a work around to the Mono issue that would allow ECO to work with Linux.  This same information was given to many Linux users that had been trying to get ECO to work again and that several users reported that they now had it working on Linux.  It was explained that it was still not officially supported except as a Windows application and we had no information on how to set it up and run it on Linux and that we had no one that was available to help with installation and setup steps for Linux but that hopefully the community would be helpful.   I did tell you that you might want to contact other Linux users to see if you could contact those that now were saying they had it working and ask if they could tell you what they had done to do so.  I suggested that you ask on the forum as it would be more noticeable then leaving a message in discord and having it scroll away. I am not sure what issues people might be having now, or if there is a step that needs to be taken that people don't know about that these other users figured out and the problem they are having now is the one that existed all along.  Those users that had it working are either no longer running ECO at all or are still up and running without any problems.  We have not heard from any of these users since the time that Meta told us it was working with Linux, that they should give it a try and they reported back that it was working for them.  The Linux users that said they had it running were asked to post to the forums, if they got a chance, and explain how they set ECO up and got it running with Mono,  to help other Linux users do the same thing.  Several said they would but I don't know if anything ever got posted,  and there is really no way to demand that someone post a 'how to' in a case like this.  I do notice that one hosting company that was running ECO on Linux servers is currently not offering ECO anymore and that could mean that they hit an issue, or it could mean ECO was not a volume selling title or 10 other reasons that have nothing to do with the game not running,  there is no real way to tell.  I would have assumed that if the people that got it running are still playing and its stopped working again they would have come back to let the devs know and find out if there was another work around.  Since its been less then 2 months since they got their servers working again I would think that its most likely that they are not having an issue that has brought them back to see if anything can be done.  I will try contact the ones I know said they had it working and ask again if they would post the information you need to get it running."

Then Fishing Traps - do they work and if yes you need some food to put inside? Can you plant tomatoes - and if yes how? I can harvest them but did not find out how to plant them. What about rice and mushrooms? You can harvest them somehow? How I fish I learned already. When I come across other questions I will submit them under this post. Thank you. :)

community-help,How do I activate the laser? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2331/how-do-i-activate-the-laser,3346,8,7,rentechd,Does the server have an auto restart on it so that it restarts everyday?  If it does that could be your issue because if the generators turn off or the server reboots you have to start powering the lasers all over again.  They don't hold the power.  There are many servers out there that do 2 -3 restarts a day and that would keep your lasers from ever being fully powered You will need at least 4 lasers and they will take 9.5 + real (not game) hours to charge up - then you should have the button active to fire them if all the processes were followed completely and the lasers are all equally powered

community-help,My Private server.... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2823/my-private-server,2245,8,1,babydluv81,I have followed the instructions from the wiki etc and downloaded the server files and started my own server. However.. I'm running into a lot of questions I can't find answers for.. Like.. For instance: I'm so lost here and nothing I've found really helps.. Everything says 'here you set it up then done' well that's fine. yes the server is there.. or was at least.. but then nothing else to go with it... sighs Could someone help?? I'm not that stupid when it comes to this sort of stuff but for some reason I just keep hitting a wall here..
community-help,My Private server.... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2823/my-private-server,2245,8,2,babydluv81,oh and 4) how do I reset the server ? or restart it without having to uninstall and reinstall everything..?
community-help,My Private server.... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2823/my-private-server,2245,8,3,Mog,".2) After adding yourself to the admin list you need to save (file>save), and then restart the server. In needs to load the file to register the changes .4) To create a new world what I do is you in the server folder, delete Storage/Game.eco and then when you restart the server it will create a new world. (Game.eco is the save file. If you want to use a backup. Delete Game.eco, name a backup file Game.eco and put it at it's place.) For the server I don't know I wasn't able to set up my own either, the wiki guide is the best help out there as far as I know."
community-help,My Private server.... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2823/my-private-server,2245,8,4,emmeck,To add to what mog said to do with the admin list part make sure you spell you in-game name exactly as it is in game.. most of the time the first letter is a capital letter
community-help,My Private server.... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2823/my-private-server,2245,8,5,babydluv81,I did. I made it Babydluv81 which is the exact capital and punctuation etc I use in game.  I wasn't sure which file to delete until you mentioned it so I ended up just deleting and reinstalling.  I did add myself to the admin list before loading it this time but doesn't seem to be a change. How do I enable commands like TP and Give etc?
community-help,My Private server.... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2823/my-private-server,2245,8,6,babydluv81,well.. with all the names etc being always capitalized I could no longer be sure of the spelling. So I added them all to the admin list lol. Which apparently worked. now it doesn't say give command didn't' work just said couldn't find the item lol.  So thanks. Some of this was helpful.
community-help,My Private server.... | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2823/my-private-server,2245,8,7,emmeck,@babydluv81 for the TP command have you installed a modkit that has the TP command in it? i suggest clayc's toolkit

If paypal is not taking your credit card it could be that you have a paypal account using the same email and so should go through that account or there is an issue with your credit card and either paypal is rejecting it or your bank/credit card provider is rejecting paypal.

We currently have an issue with some payments via PayPal and you might not receive your game right away. Some how some of the data is getting list on PayPal's site sometimes  and we need to fix accounts manually. Right now what we are doing is checking several times a day all PayPal transactions and add people manually and mailing them. So what do you need to do when you encounter the issue? First of all if you have the same mail on your Eco account that you have on your  and your PayPal you need to do nothing. I will just fix it and mail you. If you don't use the same mail you need to mail me with your PayPal mail or your PayPal transaction id and your Eco username or Eco account mail. You might see me sending a mail first asking for your Eco details on your PayPal mail and then sending you a mail maybe on your game account mail. Don't worry about that then its just because i check all PayPal stuff first and then go trough all mails. In general you need to give me between 12-24 hours to resolve your issue but i am checking now PayPal several times a day ( when i am not sleeping .. and i need some sleep too =P For any questions you can still mail me under support@strangeloopgames.com ! thanks and lets hope we get that issue fixed soon =)

community-help,Struggling setting up a public server | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2707/struggling-setting-up-a-public-server,1422,4,1,Mog,"Hey, so I installed EcoServer. it's been fun playing solo a bit. But when it comes to making it a public server I'm stuck. I have mostly been following this tutorial. Pretty good tutorial, but I still can't figure it out. I can't access my server other than by using localhost. My server isn't publicly visible in game, and I can't access the associated website remotely either.
I have been trying to connect to the <myIP>:3001 website from my phone on the local network, using the local ip of my pc, no success. It doesn't work with my public ip either obviously. All i get is a timeout. I can see it fine with localhost:3001 from my pc. When i try using <myIP>:3000 (the port of the server not the website) I don't get a timeout but an invalid http response. Which is interesting because the same rules are set up for the two ports, both in the windows firewall and my router. I've tried this website too http://canyouseeme.org/ and I have the same results. :3001 is a timeout and :3000 is a success. So the problem can't be the router as it doesn't work on the local network either. And it can hardly be the firewall. I have the rules set. I deactivated windows firewall for a bit and tested, it didn't work better. So I'm at a loss.
I don't have any other firewall. I have avast free version that doesn't contain a firewall, and nothing else. I'm on windows 8.1 by the way.
And have EcoServer set to run as an administrator. This is my network config in EcoServer. Nothing special. .
I tried putting <myIP>:3000 instead of Any. Both public and local. It didn't help. When I look at the resource monitor I see this 
The system process is related to the eco server. When I close EcoServer the process disappear. So it isn't a conflicting processus.
I don't know What is going on with the UDP port, it wasn't in the tutorial. I set some rules to allow it through too, both TCP and UDP, It didn't help. This is what netstat tells me 
Both the server and the associated website are listening. Even though the website can't seem to communicate with the rest of the world. I don't know if the fact that they have different local ips should worry me. I pretty much tried all I could think off. Pls send help."

Copy the last one. Return to the storage folder,  delete Game.eco, past the backup file and rename it Game.eco, and then launch your server. Everything should be back like it was before."

I've been struggling to find any information on how to make the excavator work and I think i figured it out last night. First, make sure you have some gasoline to power the excavator, without gas, it will not move at all. Once you have gasoline in the excavator, and you get in, you'll notice that it has the same driving mechanisim as the powered cart.
W = Forward
S = Back
A/D = Left and Right When you are ready to use the scoop, press the number 1 key on the keyboard, this will switch you to that mode, and you'll notice AWSD no longer works.  When you are done with the scoop, press the number 1 key again to switch to driving mode. Use the number pad to control the arm up down, left and right. Then use the mouse, and press the left mouse button to pickup items, and move the mouse up and down to move the arm forward and back. I hope this helps, I wish they would update the wiki with these new items."

Please see the pinned post in support about how to report bugs - it has a link to where you post bugs on github.  they will probably need to see your game save file and crash logs

I unzipped the Game.eco file, deleted the data file inside the Laws directory, then re-packed the folder using the default Windows ""archive this folder"" feature, and renamed Game.zip back to Game.eco. However, now when I start the server, it seems it doesn't recognize the stored data, as it starts a fresh instance of the server, generating new terrain on startup, and showing ""0 claimed properties"" in the property manager. Did I do it wrong? Do I need to take extra steps to make the unzipping/zipping work?"

community-help,Research table not crafting | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2687/research-table-not-crafting,4960,11,10,OzHawkeye,"Well, here's what I did: Dug down several layers (7 exactly I think). Dug out a 7x7 base, and laid down a mortared stone floor. The outside ring also become walls, leaving a 5x5 interior floor. Built a stockpile on that. Built the walls up 5 levels. A 6th level then became the mortared stone roof. Laid a layer of dirt over that, completely covering the entire structure. Tailings still leak. @emmeck, unfortunately I'm not up to a furnace yet, just got the Bloomery working. The problem is, there's basically zero documentation I've been able to find on precisely how to encase the tailings. For example, people say dig down, ok, but how far? Do I need to go all the way to bedrock? Does bedrock even exist in this game? Clearly what I've done isn't working as the pollution isn't clearing up - but then again, maybe it is, and I just haven't waited long enough - again, there's no documentation saying precisely how long pollution lasts. I'm not trying to rip on the game overly here, I understand that it's still basically pre-alpha, and I've put up with the bugs, and the awful FPS I'm getting on the understanding I'm not playing a Gold-release game yet, but the lack of documentation is a real killjoy - many of the entries in the games wiki lead to blank pages, or indeed to no pages at all, and even where entries do exist, they're extraordinarily brief and, to be blunt, not at all helpful. @stormoffires - thanks for the offer, and I guess I might end up having to join a server. I usually prefer to work things out for myself (I don't want to burden other players with too many in-game ""how does [x][y][z] work), but, sans documentation, this has proven so far to be a frustrating experience. @Reeyaz Sorry to hijack your thread to. Hope you got the research table working though. :-)"

IMPORTANT: Initially my computer DID have an IPv4 and an IPv6, however after some configuration with the network agents, we've disabled the DS-lite tunnel ""IPv6"" on my gateway.  
After setting up everything and making sure everythingall ports were forwarded and weren't being obstructed, i launched http://localhost:3001 to make sure the server was at least working.

IF you are on light green grass you use sickle on wheat!  If you are on dark green grass food is more plentiful hit E on FERN and Huckleberries that grow in forest areas. In order to till the ground you have to make a HOE which means you need agriculture skill tree and then you need to put points in it til you can craft a FARMERS WORKBENCH (currently looks like a chest when placed in the world) Once you make that bench it allows you to craft your hoe which is what tills the ground. PS farming at lvl 1 takes FOREVER if you are growing your own food you want to put points into speed increase asap!

They may often give away the skill to people so they don't have to research it on their own, and also can give away a hoe in return for minimal payment. Unlike most games, there seems to be an aspect of.. lets call it real life.  One person farms, another person works with steel.  It's very hard (or very time consuming) to be able to get all the skills in the game so it benefits the population to have people skilled in certain areas.  So it's to our benefit that you be able to get the basic farming in early on, so you can use your resources skilling up something else.    Perhaps at some point it'd even be better to just feed the player and have them focus on other work (like Nuclear Physics).

community-help,5.5 Client memory issue | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1988/5-5-client-memory-issue,2014,7,2,Auzze,"HI.. I get 18% CPU usage and 29% Memory. I think you may have some bad ram. (this is only a suggestion) This is why to test your memory.
RAM sticks, known for their chip creep and random failures, are among the more annoying pieces of hardware to pinpoint as the source of a technical issue. Before you start digging around in the tower, it's best to start with a quick and free memory check via Windows. This way, you'll know whether or not it's worth swapping around sticks of RAM to see which one is the dud. Here's how to get started: Step 1: Open the Start Menu and type in mdsched.exe, then press enter. Step 2. A pop-up will appear on your screen, asking how you'd like to go about checking the memory. The first option will restart your machine and check the memory right now, and the second option checks the next time you choose to reboot. Pick the option that best suits your needs. Step 3: Your computer will load a screen that shows the progress of the check and number of passes it will run on the memory. Watch the memory diagnostic tool for errors. If there are no errors, then it's likely that your RAM is not causing any issues, and it's time to investigate other hardware or software issues. THX"

What OS is this? Did you delete all the 5.4 client files before unzipping 5.5 into the directory?  I have seen this happen to people who just applied the 5.5.zip over the 5.4 installation and did not remove the files in the ECO directory first but once they delete all the files in the directory they have ECO in and install the 5.5 files fresh they are able to start up the game without it choking and churning up the CPU.

community-help,My notes from migrating from 0.5.5.3 to 5.6 | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2533/my-notes-from-migrating-from-0-5-5-3-to-5-6,884,3,1,frenchy128,"Team, I thought I'd share my findings on my quest to upgrade an old world (0.5.5.3) to the current version (5.6). Please note that this is not recommended by the Eco Dev's, and is not supported by any devs! Please do not bug them for any support on how to convert your old games to current version. This is unsupported, and was strictly for my amusement. I received the email yesterday about the 5.6 release, and I asked on Discord if there was any issues with upgrading your old world to current version. Pam mentioned that.. Frenchy its recommended that you create a fresh world
if you want to try and use a 5.5 world you can but you will lose everything in in tables and chests etc and it might have other issues.  couple of people have done it - but said they had to edit many files to get it to work right but its up to you.
the devs do recommend that you start a fresh world
its the change to linked inventories that is the problematical change So of course, I had to try to convert my old world to new. Wifey and I stuck on version 0.5.5.3 at the time as we found some of the bugs at the time didn't work for us, so we stuck to 5.5.3 instead of jumping to 5.5.4. I won't bore everyone with my narrowing down the problem, and leave you with the notes that worked me. I'll post an update later after playing a few hours with wifey to let you know how it played out, but at least I was able to get the console loaded, with no errors, and a successful ""Converting World"" message. Steps I Took: After isolating the source of the error message, looks like carts were causing my issue. By removing all Powered and Wood Carts seem to fix my issue, now on to other testing to see what else broke. I hope this was informative. **Again, as mentioned above, this is not supported by the Dev's, They will always recommend starting a fresh game between versions. **"

Game.eco is a compressed file and you do need to use winzip, but all the configuration files also use the .eco extension and are not compresses (zipped) files.  They are actually just text files.  Associating .eco with winrar or winzip will then cause issues if you go to open a configuration file - and winzip tried to open a  text file. My advise is to skip the step associating .eco to winzip or winrar - it will not keep you from using them for opening (extracting) Game.eco you just have to select winrar or winzip (or 7z for that matter) as the tool to use to extract game.eco."

Again I stress that this is not supported by the Dev's, and was only a fact finding mission on my behalf to see if it was possible. I would not suggest trying this. Well, Wifey and I finally decided to get back to Eco, and the migrated world seems to have worked for the most part. When we started the world, I was surprised to see that my generators were still going and that unlike the release notes, all my chest still had there contents. The problem we ran into was that we couldn't take or put anything in the chest. The chests that had big materials (ore, tailings, gold, stone, etc..) were basically not usable. At this point we decided that we start a new world, was hoping that our Seed for our world would generate the same world on 0.5.6, but it didn't. Also not having an understanding of how the stockpiles worked, presented us with a learning curve that we weren't ready for. I see the value to starting a new world, and starting fresh to get a handle on how the new stockpiling system works. Overall, I would say that the while the migration was a success (no errors after my intial changes), it left us with a partially broken world, filled with chest that we couldn't manage/empty. Thanks for reading my update. Again I mention, this is not a support process, nor will I help/assist anyone trying to migrate an old world from a previous alpha version. Please do not solicit anyone on discord, or the support forums for this kind of support."

For the server - I am pretty sure that, while it is doable, its going to have huge resources issues especially with the CPU as the game, at least during world generation is highly resource intensive.  It also would need more RAM.  You would need to run a Windows OS as the server is only supported for windows. Now if your talking about the client - RAM and CPU will still be an issue and so too maybe network communications that might lag out your game.  The client will run on Linux and Mac and if you put Linux on the NAS it might do better for you. I would actually not recommend that you go out and purchase an NAS for this game but if you have one sitting at home and want to try it out it would be worth a try I guess except that it might require you to sink money into it for CPU and RAM upgrades to even try."

1: use the admin /unclaim command on land claimed by another, and create a new plot deed by reclaiming the land,
2: a fully effective method but requires a bit more work, is to fully delete the profile of the person who's data you want removed.
To do so you have to do the following actions.
1: stop the server, 2: go to eco storage, and open Game.eco file, with winzip/winrar or other program that can open the file, after opening the file go to the folder Users, and inside there delete the file of the player you want removed completely from your server, then save the file. and start the server again."

It would be great if an admin could get the pollution meter as well as it would show much easier where the source of pollution spread is coming from.
community-help,pollution meter? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2364/pollution-meter,2037,5,4,rentechd,"The hydrology tool is not really needed as the soil sampler also give soil moisture readings along with soil condition - so you really don't need a second tool too tell you want the soil moisture is.  And there is no 'water table' for like digging wells and that sort of things so the tool as I understand it was removed and that's why you can make it or get it with a skill.   I think the  video with the ""pollution meter"" was a video of a test build and it never made it into the game as there are other ways to 'judge' pollution by its effects and the world stats.  I dn't know if the hydrometer might come in if weather is added but its not in now as it does not really serve a purpose as there is no ""moisture' anywhere but in the soil and in a body of water"

I do not know if a ban function is being added by the devs. There is no way to reset a currency; actually currency hoarding (player getting currency and not using it or leaving the game while holding it) is part of the management of the game. Just like there is no way to delete anyone objects there is no way to delete  other players stuff.  If you could delete players things you would be curing pollution in the game.

Values are variable, depends on the server, amount of active citizens, amount of resources available, how easy is to get, time to be manufactured, level of difficulty to manufacture and so on.... If there is a currency, the amount of coins in the world will also have influences on prices.  If there is too much money for few people, the market will be inflated, people will charge more since there is a lot of money and new citizens may have more difficulty .
There must be a balance between the number of active players and the amount of money circulating in the world to not have currency devaluation, inflation, etc. The leader must impose limits and taxes and In some cases, allocate people money in the treasury to reduce the amount of money and increase currency value until the population grows.

This is a intresting question you have here, so intresting i did a few test also.
to see what you exactly mean with, and yes this is a litle bump on the road. Im not 100% sure why its not working as im no pro on networking, but i think the problem is the following, from my seting. Server 1:
Gameserverport: 3000 tcp
webserverport: 3001 tco
Port X: 2999 udp Server 2:
Gameserverport: 3002 tcp
webserverport: 3003 tcp
Port X: not active. I think that for a server to show up on the eco public server list, udp port 2999 is used. as there are no config options to change this port (at least from what i can find), the problem is that server 2 in my test setting could not send a signal to the public server list service, as udp port 2999 was already in use by server 1. Would be nice if this was made configurable in the future, for now a work around has to be found i geus. i dont know if its possible but if there are programs that can intercept network traffic from a program in this case server2.eco and redirect to to example port 2998 it would be a work around solution."

There are people that have to refresh their list 3-5 times to see their own server that resides at their house and only runs one instance but make sure that bug is not confusing your issue. Are you able to see the server/connect to the server  manually once its up and running even if its not view-able in the in-game browser? As for memory leaks, they have not been that much of an issue on the server.  the bad one is the one on the client and that we leave up to the individual player.  As for the server we just have a scheduled task that the server admin for that instance sets up restart the server instance daily and that seems to solve the issue.  Of course, they can recycle that instance anytime they wish.

This one has authentication via web browser.  After logging in there, a message came up saying I was being blocked as a possibly compromised computer.

The server/client does broadcast/listen on UDP port 2999 to look for any other running servers of Eco, but this is fairly standard discovery practice. Is that restriction on all port ranges?  Eco does default to a pretty low port number which some security programs do not like. Either way there is no way at the moment to change/disable the LAN scan at the moment, but we can add support for it if you want to create a bug about this issue."

1: You have to move the modded files you moded, to the new position the should be in, depending on where you installed them and what kinda mods u used.
2: the mode have to be compatible with the newer version of the server, And if the are not you have to recode them, or the creator of the mod must have a newer version of the mod compatible with the never server version."

I would expect that if you are not getting anything then you need to plant in a different place that matches the crop you want to grow. Different crops like different temp and moisture. I created a little table of the crops for me, just plant them one at a time and check their requirements. Its also easier to see that stats you need if the block is raised so you can see the side of it. Good luck."

By the sounds of it, you're encountering the 100% loading error bug. This is what happens when for some reason, (it could be a number of reasons) You have fallen through the map so low that the game doesn't know how to load where you currently are. The only current fix known is to have the server admin directly move you back to spawn using a teleport mod, or have the server admin revert to a backup save previous to you falling through the map. Two players on the server I host have encountered this issue when they log off, so when they log back in, they are unable to load in. Luckily, my server has a mod on it which allows Me or an admin to teleport you back to default spawn when you're offline. With this in mind, the only way to play on that server again is to contact the admin and have them fix it for you. Otherwise, play on a new server."

The best way is the keep refreshing your server list and look for it in the list and make sure you have restarted your game after removing the non working saved ip.  Don't forget to favorite it so You don't lose it when u do. It seems sometimes servers only show for a short pried of time after it has restarted.

Add me to Steam Alderone (ECO WASTE) or hop on are teamspeak3 tomorrow between 6-8pm EST.

I'm playing on all the basic graphics settings too, my PC is like 4 years old but I can happily play Arma & Day-Z on Ultra settings but my PC can't handle ECO a game with less going on.

We are aware of that eco will utilize 100% of your computer performance right now, Even on high en system because of some missing optimization. But that should not turn of your computer unless there is something else critically wrong with your pc. Like heat issues that is often caused by heat as an example. Removing dust from your cpu and gpu resolves this issue in most cases. Also if you have any overclocking you might wanna disable that because overclocking can make your pc unstable."

The launcher for Eco is Very simple download it and extract it into a folder you have made called Eco somewhere on your hard drive. I put mine into program files. Then simply double click the game file to start the game. Once in the game you will be on a server list. adding a known server by ip is currently not working on the server list  at the moment so you will just have to pick a server. If you like a server you can click the box on the left of it to favorite the server to your list. To get white-listed to a private server you will need to contact that servers owner or admin. Or you can join 1 of meany community servers that are public to everyone like the one I am currently running. (ECO WASTE) If your looking for tutorials we have a couple on are you tube and also are on website(links below). As far as commands for basic players there are not meany. But they work like minecraft.
Example: /players Shows online player list I'm sure they will add more as the game gets further in development. Mods are slim to none at this time but there are some. Others can get to a map for your server by the in game link or if a server provides a link on there website like seen on ecoeasteserver.com. If you have any other questions I would be happy to help as best I can"

There is another option you can explore. To play on my home minecraft server from work, I used port mapping on my home router. The way this works is it takes an external connection on a particular port, and then redirects it internally to the port you specify. So in this case, you could redirect incoming port 443 on your home router/modem (Traditionally reserved for HTTPS, so your school will allow this traffic out) and have that map to incoming port 3000 (unsure which specifically is for Eco) Still have your standard 3000-3001 mapping, but this port redirection as well. Then at school:
Add server:

For any user that is never getting passed the 100% object loading bug. The issue has been found and a fix has been made. Sadly that fix will Require a larger update affecting client and server so no hotfix server for that right now. Eric aka Metachronism made a little tp thingy as a workd around for now that you can use .
You can use it while the person is offline so just type /tpo ExactPlayerName and it will fix that for you .. you also have to add this file here into your mods / commands folder usertp-fix.cs So you have to manually fix those users for a short time .. Thanks"

But on both instace, after a few minutes of walking, I get into a void of space where no chunks are generated then I get disconnected. I also suspect it may have something to do with my ISP. My question is ... how does joining a server work, network-wise.
Do I connect directly to the server or is there another layer of auth before checking into the server? I'll try to traceroute a server later to see if there's an anomaly between me and the server. I'll show you the results later when I get home."

From what your telling me it does sounds like a conection related problem, and yes i believe the server does have another layer of conecting.
As a server hase a option to authenticate a player acount and like 95% of all server hase that enabled i asume that it first conects to strange look authentication server, and then back to the game server. To be 100% sure its conection related, and not cause of hardware conflicts, fps, or any thing in that direction there is 1 thing you still can test if you havent already, go to your eco acount on the website and download the server file, its all preconfiged only thing you have to do is press extract, and run it wait a few minits till it rendered a world, And then join your own server showing up under Lan in your eco game client, to see if it runs longer then a few minits there."

It should be mentioned that I'm using pingperfect to host my server, which does not allow me to alter .dll files for security reasons. They do have the hotfix available to install as an update, and I had one of their support people manually install the hotfix after their patch didn't seem to work. Neither of these attempts worked and I ended up resetting the server.  Before I reset the server I tried to reinstall vanilla 5.4, without the hotfix, and loaded up a backup file from before the problem, but it didn't work then either.
I updated the server with the hotfix and all other fixes since 5.4 came out and started up the new server. it seems to work fine now. Not sure why it was crashing prior to the reset."

But after some unusual ways i managed to make it work. Problem was when i applied it to my server,i saw no conversion of the map to fix the corrupted chunk, But when i applied the fix to a a fresh empty server with a copy of the corrupted map.
The corrupted map it started to convert the map on first time boot up.
So i converted map on a test server, copied it back to main server, And on main server it converted it again, And the problem was solved. Thanks for the fix,"

You dont get a mail with a key, the game is just applied to the account you created while buying eco. One thing i have seen that people pay not normally with a visa or any other credit card might have to wait allot longer since the account page waits for paypal to confirmation that the payment has been received. So if you pay by e check this might take a long time or even get canceled if you dont follow that payment up."

Playing Eco for a week now, with 5.5 I want to get my own server, won't be worrying about a wipe anymore and stuff like that. So, in general I want a server where everyone has the same rights and stuff, don't want spawn any items (if that's even possible), but I'm concerned in one thing: The townhall. As the admin of the server I would like to run/build the townhall, that's the only advantage I would like to have, is there a possibility to do this? I checked youtube, the wiki and forums to get some infos about the townhall in general, but couldn't find really helpful things I guess. Thanks in advance."

This would allow you to restrict other players from building/removing anything from said area, and if you do not lock the chests in the area, they should be able to access them.

If what you want is different, prod me. Option 1 You are the first person to be able to learn Elections. If someone tries to learn it before you, it will fail and they will be messaged saying they need to wait for you to learn it first. The modified Elections skill: Elections.cs There is a string on line 34 called playerWhoMustBeFirst. This determines who will be the first to read the Elections skill scroll. If anyone else tries to read it before them, they will fail and get a message saying ""playerWhoMustBeFirst must be the first person to learn Election"". The file I have uploaded currently has this set to ""Fobicafa"" so if that is your in-game name as well, you just need to drop the file into Mods/AutoGen/Tech on the server. Option 2 Only you and your friend can learn it all. If you just don't want anyone else to learn it then this is what you want. File download is in the post below. I can't upload two different files with the same name in the same post so see below. On line 34, there is a list of strings called allowedUserNames. This is a list of the usernames that are allowed to learn the Elections skill. The file uploaded below has ""Fobicafa"" and ""FobicafasFriend"" in that list. I imagine your friend is not named that so you'll probably want to change it. The file goes in the same place as the one above would go. In testing locally with my trained monkey, it worked but I didn't spend much time testing so prod if it doesn't work or you want something different."

After that i have followed the advanced 'how to setup your ports' guide. When i go to the external ip adress at port 3001 with a browser the page loads up just fine. I can see the webpage and it loads fine.
When i go with telnet to the external ip adress on port 3000 i can also establish a connection. (i can even see it in the server 'DOS box')
Last thing i did was set the  PublicServer = True on the Network/Config tab and made sure that under Users/Config the value PrivateServer is set to False.
Al tests i have done are from computers that are not in the same LAN. I loaded it from my Phone, used computer at work etc. I have a few random questions: If anyone can help me get the servr to appear in the server list i'd be very happy. Thanks in advance,

ive had this problem myself also on the server, i dont have a fix but do have a work-around if you fellows want to get your server back up.
Try the back-up files the server made, if the first back up gives thes crash again after x minit try a older back-up,
it hase something to do with the location of a cart in the world save and booting the server.
so if the cart is not on the problem location you can atleast use your world again on the server."

Hi there just awake so i did a fast copy paste from another topic where i did a short explanation in case you havent found it yet. By default the eco server setings make a back-up every 30minits and keeps 5 back-ups you can adjust it to more or less save intervalts and more or less back-ups kept depending on your diskspace availible, if the host is not always 100% reliable, Copy the last back-up to another location online or on your local pc. If you dont know how it works here is a short explanation/example.
Default server map structure: \EcoServer_v0.5.4-alpha\Storage\Backup
Copy the last newest file in backup to another save location, local or online, (example file name : 02-22-2017-12.37.40.eco)
To restore your server from the back-up file. Copy the back-up file to,
\EcoServer_v0.5.4-alpha\Storage And rename the file to: Game.eco Your server save file is restored, even after wiping a server just make sure to have a back-up file stored and keep it up to date. Greetings Zaskersky,"

community-help,Trouble Running Public Game | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1695/trouble-running-public-game,8827,21,11,NoBlackThunder,There is an odd bug i have seen. ! When you add the port via giving the application path then it will not work .You have to specify the ports directly like in my guide to make it work. That's because windows firewall and antivirus and 3rd party firewalls dont see the web port that is been opened after the server starts and still keep blocking them. While if you login via lan you will get access to the game via the discovery udp packages

community-help,Trouble Running Public Game | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1695/trouble-running-public-game,8827,21,13,NoBlackThunder,The guide that i linked shows how to set up a server including ports. It also has a small section about troubleshooting network issues. You need to find out where the issue happens .. is it the server ports that are causing the issue or is it your router?  Easiest way to test that is with a mobile phone by connecting via wifi first and see if you can get anything from the law page and then redoing that via mobile 3g network
community-help,Trouble Running Public Game | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1695/trouble-running-public-game,8827,21,14,Ryve,"Like I said before.
It is not a port issue since I can't even access the law page from my mobile on the same wifi, let alone via mobile network.
I can access it on localhost, so the server is running correctly.
I went through your entire guide twice including the troubleshooting section before posting here.
Nothing solved it. I have hosted a working server before.
The only thing that has changed is that it is a newer version of the Eco server that has made some considerable changes on the network front with alpha 4. The server is set to public and ports are still the default ones.
Even though my firewall shouldn't block them(like in the past) I made a new rule, both inbound and outbound just to be sure, with full access open on port 3000-3001."

The troubleshooting has been a lot harder then it needed to be because for some reason the web service crashes chrome on my cellphone.
This is apparently why I couldn't connect to it from that device.
I have tried with a different device and I can actually connect to the web service through port 3001 from a device outside my local network. The server is however still offline for everyone else.
The only thing left in the trouble shooting guide is to make sure that the server isn't mistakenly private.

Ive also hade this problem, a way to fix the problem is using a back-up of the server, by default the server does a back-up every 30minits and saves 5 back-up's. after using the back-up its should be good in most cases, if the server still crashes at the same point of time after using the back-up.
It means there is a cart in your world that keeps causing it to crash, ask the server members to remove there carts and place em again. @Kampfkarnickel

There are currently 7 online on the server wich seems odd to me that I shouldn't be able to connect? Server name: ECO Official EU Alpha 5 Test Server 275 Citizens (7 online)"

If I send them an invitation does that give them a key which they can then give to someone else, or is it locked to the email address I send it to? If it's reusable, would that mean I can send the invitation to the same email I used for my account just so I can generate the extra key? I don't really care how it's accomplished, I just don't want to have to ask for the winner's email address, or ask my friend to do the giveaway without the key in hand."

The way the current system operates based on my own experience since I got the 4 pack, is you use the invite function on your account and input the email of the winner in your case, it then gives them a private personal link to follow for them to then set up their account with ECO and download the game. As of current there is no 'key' as such that is generated it is operated through private email invites. The only way this would is to ask for their email or one that that they can get access to, in order to get the link. Perhaps you can do this though say Discord or other private messaging system. If your looking to get the key moving alone quickly I have a number of contacts eager to get involved in the game."

The invite is locked to the person you send it to . Its also a good idea to not write a wrong mail because our account system is also something that is still work in progress and makes it a bit hard to track down and correct those wrongly typed email addresses. So you have sadly to ask the winner for there mail address

The game runs just fine when I play on my own server locally, but when I try to play on an online server, it feels like the game runs fluid for 1 second, then pauses, probably waiting for a reply from the server, then runs for 1 sec and pauses again and so on. Those ""pauses"" last for maybe 100mS, but it's very annoying and makes the game unplayable online. I have tried multiple online servers, at different ""days"" into the game, and with different population. I tried low ping and higher ping servers as well, doesn't seem to make a difference. I am running on windows 7, I tried the 32 and the 64 bits versions. My computer meets the system requirements, this doesn't seem to be video card related because the game runs perfectly fine on my local server, even with high graphics settings. My internet connection is also pretty good, with 50MBPS bandwidth and low ping so I don't think this is an issue either. If needed I can post a video of the problem."

Or delete the game.eco file.
Normally Meteor should strike after 30 days, so maybe another problem led to the server wipe. You can turn of meteor in Server settings.
You can add your self as admin in the server options -> user tab.
Then you can use this command: /give SearchAndSelectItem
To get a new workbench. The game offers much much more than just wood-chopping, but it's focused on multiplayer, so you should search the server browser and find a server with some players on it."

I just found it when googling for the problem in general.
It was not eco-specific, so its just a shot in the blue...
It may happen when a file is accessed mutliple times at once,
and it happened to some guy, with another software, when it rendered an image file in different sizes for web-view. It may be everything, could be a problem with volume-shadow-copy, with windows 10 file permissions, windows defender,  drivers or hardware, whatever, its very hard to diagnose @xxanderdakillar
Maybe you can find something useful in the event viewer...
Press Windowsbutton+R, type ""eventvwr"", have a look in windows protocolls, shortly after a server crash, maybe you can
find a error message wich is produced by another software."

I know the pain. The struggle is real, but that game is playable.
Although the amount of information on wiki is very low in the end I have found a lot of solutions. Most of them by myself because of trial and error. From the beggining:
At the bottom left You have skill points. A big number in small blue square indicates ow many skill points You have acquired. Below that and top to the left bottom You will find nutrition which is the most important mechanic of the game which gives an information what You ate, how much energy You have and how many skillpoints You will earn in a whole real time day. To pick an Axe which will give You an ability to chop the tree You have two options: Few first skill points spent should be spent on:

It doesn't give me a server GUI so any tweaks I make have to be done manually in the configs (which make me want to swear in Klingon from the lack of commentation, but at least y'all have solid naming conventions so I'm learning my way around.)

1 start the server and wait 10 minutes if you are hosting the server on a slow computer. Also make sure that the server has updated the .net installation to at least 4.6.2 or higher.

You could try disabling server-level authentication on your server by going to the Users tab of the server and turning it off (they will still need to log into the client, but it seems like that is already working for you)  Having this turned off shouldn't be a problem if you are just playing locally, it just ensures that the connecting user is who they say they are."

community-help,Noob question about wood carts | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1077/noob-question-about-wood-carts,2924,7,5,MaxBacon,@panisch they were doing tests with physics I think? Possibly some improvements on that area because it's too easy to just end up in space for approaching a cart xD
community-help,Noob question about wood carts | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1077/noob-question-about-wood-carts,2924,7,6,pan7s,in 4.2 you can pull a cart on the bottom of water just like land. can make ramps out of the water for it maybe? it is very wild sometimes. in 4.2 usually once i have ramps and roads all over it is very easy to recover. i also like to build walls on my roads where it could fall off so if it ever did fall it is in an area that i can recover it from easily. Perhaps they changed cart physics in 5 i'm not sure because they do not fly away on me when i walk close on 4 although when letting go sometimes it does jump pretty wild. or sometimes will roll by itself and is gone which is why i build walls on all my roads. definitely needs to be worked on a bit but those are just my tips/experiences with a cart and hopefully will help you in the future manage your cart :)

Piracy cant be allowed here... sorry but 40$ is because this is supposed to be a exclusive alpha for people who want to support development and help with it. The price on release will most likely go down or already when it goes into beta. Also we cant allow piracy here to be honest ether. The developers need money to support developing games. That said . you cant really expect us helping you with issues that is caused by piracy... i am not sure right now what i will do about this post so i have to think a bit about it.

I did end up buying it though, hehe. That being said I totally agree with you, which is why I never came here to ask for support, and just bought the game instead.
I have to admit I think the prices are a bit high for an alpha, also I dislike the fact that you (potentially) deny me to ability to buy more than 4 copies. What if I wanted 10? I think the way it's done should maybe be changed so that after getting 4 copies I can still purchase copies of the game.
Only way right would be to make a 2nd account and waste $40 since first copy would be locked to the account. Imho the price should go up after an alpha, not down. This means you are ""robbing"" backers, and rewarding those who wait. Andreas"
community-help,please help with game login | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1018/please-help-with-game-login,14386,24,21,NoBlackThunder,quick comment on that with just 4 copies.. its an know issue they are looking at .. its not intended to say no users that want more than 4 copies .. i know about a very few cases where people wanted more than 4 copies .
community-help,please help with game login | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1018/please-help-with-game-login,14386,24,22,Nertomaros,"@andreasb86 I do understand you, I'm not saying I've never downloaded a game but I, as you said, bought all the games at some point and stopped downloading completely when I was 18 or so.. The problem is that on average most don't actually buy it in the end unless there's content that they can't reach at all without having a legit copy.  Plus I'm studying as a game designer and trying to make a living out of it so it wouldn't be very smart of me to download illegal copies of other games :P Yeah. It's always been tricky with pre-release games..  On one side you're paying to access a work in progress and, hopefully, help for free in polishing the game. On the other hand, since you're supporting, it's more likely that you'll pay more money for that same reason as devs might struggle with cash.  But at the same time a lower price while still in development might help to sell more copies and get more people to try it out and give feedback. thought a fair split will just keep their copies on a shelf waiting for the game to be finished. But all of that doesn't actually matter since it has now become a common practice, and I'm not talking about Eco but the market itself. ""Pre-order to get this extra icon, get a season pass as we know there will be 4 DLC you'll have to pay for"".  ""buy ealy access to have the 'privilage' of getting the game before others"" when it's normally a paid job (QA testers). Well.. I've went off track there. Sorry for the OT but I felt like saying those couple of things :P back to my dark cave"
community-help,please help with game login | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1018/please-help-with-game-login,14386,24,23,NoBlackThunder,"Every opinion is welcome here (as long as everyone stay's respectful and / or breaks any laws by linking to pirate thinks on the forums) =) There is a good reason for the high price and why eco is doing thinks differently .. for now the reason for the 40 $ is because the alpha is supposed to be exclusive. meaning that it most likely will drop later when it goes into beta / release version. On top of that the idea about making it more expansive is because : (dont take my word though for this the way i got this explained its a bit hard to understand maybe and i have trouble explaining thinks like this very well) Eco is doing allot of thinks differently .. like having the dev tier where you can get access to the source code and help even out with coding and creating the game (The team is pretty small and there is always a time limit on how long you can work on a game with a given amount of money so having the community help on some more simpler task to make the game even better is pretty cool) If you look at the backup system between alpha 4 and 5 you can see that you can now have multiple backups that i helped implement because i feel this was a very nice feature to have this early (since you can still can get corrupted worlds from time to time .. it helps at least a bit) you cant of course not give the source out for free since that would make it easier to make a pirate version for everyone ( therefore the high price on that tier) but you can actually earn money if you implement several larger community task or get more free game copies for helping out like this. (ref: https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoBugBounties ). I honestly don't know a single game that allows this and its a pretty cool idea. Personally i think the whole way this gets handled and how its done is a pretty cool idea =) And now lets talk a bit about piracy ... most users have pirated something at some point in there life .. like a single song , or a movie or even a tv show .. some people pirate pc games. The Issue is that developers and content creators need money to create more content / games. We cant therefore allow piracy here. its not cheap making a game and i hope that even if some of you pirated the game i hope you buy it later if you like it at least and support this game and the developers."

community-help,How to set up a private server using Hamachi by logmein | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/961/how-to-set-up-a-private-server-using-hamachi-by-logmein,7691,6,1,Trygeth,"This is an alternative method to setting up a Private Server using Hamachi. It is a Virtual Private Network. If nothing else has worked for you. You can try it this way. It's Pretty much sharing your LAN with your friends. We had been trying and trying with other means but to no avail. It drove us mad. I hope this works. The first thing you are going to want to do is make sure you have downloaded all of the server files from the main Eco website. It is located under your account and is below the download clients. Next after you have successfully downloaded and extracted the files you are going to want to run the Server Watcher file. It will launch a command window. Let it fully run its course it will open a new window. Here you can change settings like; Network Server name, world generation and what not. When it does open this window though it is ready to test to see if you LAN Server is working. To test this run the game normally and your server name will be located under the yellow LAN list. Next you are going to completely exit the server and the games including the server watcher. Then go and download,Hamachi-Logmein. After you have successfully downloaded Hamachi you will need to set up a network within it. If you need help with that there is an easy Tutorial here After you have made your network give your Network ID and Password to your friends. Once they have joined you will need to launch the Server Watcher once again. Then have your friends launch the game and copy and paste your Hamachi IP. They do this by right-clicking your name and selecting Copy IPv4 Address. Alternatively you could click the top next to the power button and give them the address. They will have to paste the address in the ADD SERVER section in the game. It is located on the top of the server list. It says Address and port but you don't need a port. After that it should show up if not refresh and it should let you connect to it. This has worked for me and my friends if it does not please leave a comment. I did this on PC I have no Idea if it works on any other OP. I hope that this helps. P.S. If you would like to join my private server just let me know."

community-help,Stair Placement | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/960/stair-placement,2853,7,7,Furbal,I've found that the only way to be sure your stairs face the way you want them to is to have a wall on either side of them or have them 2 stairs wide with a wall on one side (minimum). Walls on both sides are the best bet though.

But please keep in mind that Eco is still in a very early alpha stage. Bugs will happen and some might take a longer time to get fixed then others. The reason for this is that normally you do a system that is sort of a concept system and then work on a new system .. later on each system gets reworked and also bugs. Its all about time vs cost unfortunately. There are plans to make future release more bug free.  If its a very big issue i would like if you can wait until beta release when there is more focus on fixing bugs and less adding new systems.

You can tax any table with items/resources on a per hour basis. Example: I've taxed Bloomery to 1 Iron Ore per hour, meaning any operation taken by a user on the server cost 1 Iron Ore per hour.
If they run small jobs minimum pay of 1 Iron Ore is required. Assume I taxed 60 Iron Ore per 1h (in short for every minute a job is run it would cost them 1 Iron Ore) (this would be insane but a great example)
If somebody runs a 30m job they need to pay 30 Iron Ore.
If somebody runs a job for 1m = 1 Iron Ore, 10m = 10 Iron Ore etc.
Essentially for every portion of the 1h frame based on what the main taxation is it will require you to pay the time spend in tax. The resources a user pays in tax automatically lands in the Treasury Table for the leader to use."

This is mostly during world generation, where it will generally use 100% of all cores until its finished.  World generation can take quite a while for larger worlds - a 1km² world takes about 10 minutes for example on a 4-cpu machine. There is currently an issue if you run the server on a machine with only 1 logical processor - it will crash unless you have at least 2 (1 HT core is fine since that is 2 logical cpus) Once the world is generated though, cpu usage should be very low, but will fluctuate depending on number of connected users.

We tried powering our Factory with a single gen and that doesn't seem to work, or it doesnt work well.
We setup (1 Comb + 1 Elec gen) and 2 Induction Gens (work much better) just fuel them and they create Electricity directly without having to filter through Comb Gen -> Elec Gen)
To get the factory running we ran all three at the same time. The yellow lines you see on the power grid for Power Sources will turn green when they are running (yellow seems like idle status) Th Factory requires 2.5k, each gen makes 1k, which made us assume you need to run 3 at the same time.
Remember to run them with Petroleum or Gasoline, we've found that Gasoline works best and might also be bugged.
After a single consumption of gasoline the Induction stopped consuming gasoline....not sure if but yet. Hope this helps.

I have a small, private server with two people.
Runs great for me (minus the memory leak) but his character is completely unplayable. Inside a public workbench items won't stack (items that normally would) so it takes a new slot for each sub-stack.
He has coal stuck in his shovel - persists through restarts, server restarts, placing shovel in chest. The coal gets placed when he empties it, but then stays in the shovel and disables it's use.
Picking up stacks only takes the 'appropriate' amount of resources 'sometimes' and often simply deletes the rest. (IE: 30 logs in a stack, take the stack, get 5 in your hands 25 in the storage - he's getting 5 in his hand and 0 in storage) --- this is becoming costly. Rather than trying to fix his character, we would like to force a re-spawn but the users.eco file is compiled and the server config doesn't seem to have an option to remove a specific character's data. Is this an option or are we stuck wiping the server and starting fresh, again?"

First CHOP THE LEAVES off the tree to get seeds... Then go up to the tree make sure you have axe equipped and tree is highlighted (green).
TOO FAR
JUST RIGHT Swing your axe at tree a few times to fell it (usually 5-10 depending on skill)
TIMBERRRR (notice it turns yellow) Once tree is on the ground you have to skin all branches and TOP of tree off they will each highlight when you hover over them in a red color.  Once you have the giant log trunk of the tree on the ground then you have to use your axe and chop the tree into smaller bits.
DON'T make them too small you can pick up a relatively large piece of wood, you know when its able to be picked up when that piece is green. Then pick E to pick up! TOO BIG
JUST Right 2: How do I farm?
You need to craft a FARMERS TABLE from a workbench.  In game model is a chest just cause it's a placeholder 3: What constitutes a ""room""?
A ""room"" I have noticed is a structure that has more than 9 blocks of ""air"" inside of it with a maximum of 2 openings. AKA ""door"" So you can build a 5x5 square of walls... but most workstations require 10 spaces of ""volume so you have to make it 5x6 someway. 4: Is there a different inventory from the backpack?
Carrying inventory, 1-0 inventory backpack and then chests in game 5: What are the controls?

I don't have much to add for the original questions but for number three I can give you some fun advice: You can construct your first building's walls out of dirt and make the roof out of wood. Assuming you have the right amount of wood (which is 10 for most things) the entire structure doesn't need to be wooden. Gotta save the forests; build dirt huts!

The other major issue that could use a bit of explaining to first timers is that you can't do anything without skills.
To answer/explain my second question, ""farming"" is not the same skill as ""gathering"".
And for question 3, I did not actually have a roof, which caused the whole issue.
I now have a wonderful little dirt cottage with a ramp straight to the beach. Thanks for all the help, and maybe this will help others to learn the game."

See http://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/734/where-do-i-find-wheat A house and garden is not basic in this game.   It's best when it's community driven.  Think of it like real life.  Do you work somewhere?  Do you have your own garden you eat only from, or do you go to the store and restaurant to buy food? It's easiest to have certain players be really efficient at food production while you focus on being efficient at something else.  If you're expecting to be able to do every skills, you have a looonnnngggg time of waiting for those skill points to grow to be able to do things efficiently. What was your response and their response to selling wheat and giving seeds?  People even saying that are a step.  Just ask what you can do in return for those seeds and do it.  Cut down a tree and stump they want removed.  I've given away seeds, hoes and the skill scroll quite often. You really don't have a use for wheat unless you cook, or you're doing your own research to be able to cook/grow food.

The people on there are hard at work trying to save that world. Someone with low skills seems to be sabotaging that, because he gets less resources from things. I haven't seen any such cooperation on other servers. I had a look around at UO, but have no idea how i could be useful there. Isn't it boring to be only logging, smelting and making steel? @jhadred What i've seen on most servers i've visited (the official server and UO being the exception), is each player having their house (with workbenches) and garden. There are no shops. There are no boards with job offers. Specialising in something is indeed more fun than everyone being able to do the same things. I guess you would need a group of people starting at server launch, with a leader and everyone filling a particular role. But at the moment i don't know enough about this game to help out like that, i'm only trying to learn the basics. I noticed a day-one server, so i decided to try that one. There are two people online. One told me he had just reset the server. I asked them if they where working together to save the world from the meteor. He responded that there is no meteor.

Going alone is just really slow and lets you just kind of play around while the other part of the world goes on.  Nothing wrong with that. As for being given some free starter stuff, why not?  I give it away exactly for the reason that wheat is hard to get.   Usually I don't need to give away the other seeds.  Giving away computers and engines... probably not.  Just accept the stuff and go and do your own thing and make friends for a group next time. If you really want to do something from scratch... start up your own server.  You can make it private if you want.  That's what I did until I learned enough about what I was doing to join a public server.   Then you do your own thing while talking to people.  Just progress. When I joined a public server, I just did my own thing while they had massive towers.    The server restarted.  I did my own thing for a tiny bit and we all discussed teaming up for some stuff and it snowballed.   Next reset we're planning a larger team deed.

community-help,Can't play :( | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/743/can-t-play,1090,2,1,kokonoe,"Hey again
Since I started playing Eco I have been playing on a server called Elysium, I built a house and a farm, even a mine and a shop, I have gotten pretty good at it but recently the server has had severe lag, to the point where the world doesn't load properly and it takes at least 15 seconds for each chunk to load in. It has made the game literally unplayable, and I do not wish to start over again on another server for fear of this happening a second time. I know this isn't the games fault as the other servers are fine, I'm just a bit upset that I may end up losing all my progress. Which is why I have decided that I will start my own server in a few weeks, that way I can guarantee it won't be a massive waste of time. Anyway, I was wondering if some of you could try connecting to Elysium to see if its super laggy for you too. Thanks :D"

First you put a point into the  Survival > Logging.  This gives you your first axe.  You can then cut down trees.  Once the tree falls the branches will fall off and disappear (do not click on the branches or stump in this version of Alpha 4 as it causes an exception error being undefined).  You can then use the axe on the trunk to make smaller sections.  The size of the section will allow you to pick up between 3 and 5 lumber.  (+more if you have additional lumber skills).
Build a building with the logs and pick up basic research so you can get a research table.  You will then be able to research the carpentry skill.  This opens up a new skill listing so you can put a point into Carpentry > woodworking.
However, you also need Civics >  workbench construction so you can get your first workbench.  This first workbench will allow you to use those logs and make boards. I can't figure out how to use the boards for building walls though... Was this what you were looking for or was it something else?"

Feedback is very important to make this a great game. so i hope you see this. also i cant see you having applied to any of the larger community's here , you should give it a try. also it seems there is going to be a server browser in alpha 4 ( and you can have custom server listener server. meaning it will be easier to find servers later and even have you own or more public server list server =) )"

Now there's just an expensive minecraft-clone, but not a single reason to buy this game (as long as if you're not as dumb as I was). It's not a god game, it's an ant game. Maybe I'll take a look in a year or two again, but I guess I better stick to some other games. (Don't get me wrong: there are some beautiful graphics and some players obviously have fun, so this game is absolutely right for some and maybe even for you, but I can understand that there are just a few guys and girls who appreciate such a gameplay)"

But yea its a very special kind of game and you are right that it might not be for everyone. its not like minecraft even though it uses some basic elements that come with voxel engines and games like this. Also there is a deep eco simulation that you might not see right away. Animal and plant life and cycle is fully simulate ( though still needs work) right now . Pollution is simulatet ( also still needs work compared to alpha 3) That's my personal view at least ;)"
community-help,Did this game die? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/553/did-this-game-die,4228,9,6,kuddel,"@NoBlackThunder said: Well, I must admit, that my words might have been a little bit harsh due some frustration. There are nice aspects which I didn't mention. But the gameplay is just not what I was expected when I read first about this game, saw some videos of the engine, read some interviews and such. Honestly, I would be really happy to see some other game on the long run, but the development seems to aim for other kind of gamers. And that's fine, it's not my decision, just my opinion. I could think of many great things when simulating a planet including climate aspects, politics, environmental impacts, wildlife and such. But I would like to try them out, even in single player. But not being ""exhausted"" for not playing a couple of days and spending hours of hours just cutting wood. I don't really mind the bugs and such, since I knew, that I ""join"" this game in an early stage and that many features are missing at the beginning. But even if those annoucements become real some day in Alpha 0.4, some beta or the final game sometime: I don't think that's what I (personally!) was expected and when I talked to some other players (which is absolute not representative and just a emotional/personal guess), they were disappointed as well. I had and still have the feeling, many people were excited about a game which is a mixture of games like black & white, godus (at an early stage before it got messed up), simcity, superpower 2 (without warfare), universim, universe sandbox (on one planet) etc., and being a little bit more ""mature"" (not cartoon-ish style graphics and ""cute"" animations of animals), but rather, as I called it, scientific. The news about the White House, the sustainability focus etc. were extremely interesting. And the graphics are fine. I saw a lot of pretty sundawns and such. But no real seasonal changes, which are not that important for me. I was more intersted in how the earth changes do to actions of the player(s). And pretty graphics and landscapes are nice to have, but not that necessary for me. A 2D game with good algorithms can be more interesting. tldr: I was expecting more like a simulator of a planet/earth with all its aspects and also many tools to play (and even mess) around and maybe even learn something about environmental, social and political things. But also have the possibility to have a little fun if you just have a few hours on your own to play this game (or better said: simulator). I didn't think of another Minecraft game to shape every little piece of earth on my own and spend so many hours without any visible changes in the game (regardless if you play alone or with a dozend of other users). Anyhow, I would be very happy to be surprised some day. But so far I'm quite unsure if this is the right game for me/us (which, of course, does not include the ""normal"" player!) and I know that the developers have to look for a wide range of potential buyers. So please don't take my critics personally."

community-help,Did this game die? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/553/did-this-game-die,4228,9,8,JohnK,"Hey Kuddel, thanks for the feedback, what you describe is exactly what we intend to build.  We're very early in production still, so you've got to use a lot of imagination. But the vision for the game has always been and will be 'the individual vs society vs environment', finding your role as an individual within an economy, government, and ecosystem, and founding that in scientific simulation. We have a long way to go before we hit that goal, but we're making steady progress (better than I expected even), and we have a full year of funding remaining, not even counting any new funds we'll receive.  That gives us the freedom to keep the game off Steam (since we don't need the money) and wait till its really polished before we make it widely available there.  The Kickstarter backers and early buyers now are people who want to help us get there with their feedback and be part of the process, have an influence on the direction of the game (which is why we have the Dev Tier as well).  So hope you'll stick with us, check it out as we update, give us feedback on what works and what you'd like to see, and we promise to listen and incorporate the ideas we can. Alpha 4 is all about government + economy + graphics improvement.  Alpha 5 will be about ecosystem/animal/pollution simulation.  And after that comes beta, which is a polish coat on everything, and then Steam Early Access after that.  No hard dates on that, but we're going to not rush it, much better to have something polished before we go mainstream. Thanks again for the feedback and dont hesitate to reach out if you have any other ideas/suggestions to share, john@strangeloopgames.com -JohnK"

The server can in fact be accessed via the public address on port 3000. However, the web interface of [Public IP]:3001 cannot be accessed. Ports 2999 to 3001 are opened both internally and externally on the router. I installed the ECO server on a different machine within the same network (Win 7) and it worked flawlessly without any lag whatsoever. However I neglected to test the web interface on 3001 with this test machine. The server seems to have all firewall exceptions enabled, without any interference from antivirus software. I can connect to the server from a client on the same network (using the server's local IP) and it acts just as slow and laggy as connecting to it remotely via the public IP does. This leads me to believe it is likely not an issue with port settings on the router (which has TCP and UDP set for 2999 to 3001). Thanks"

At the time of the issue, the other NIC was disconnected and not in use, however the adapters were still in bridge mode. Removing the bridge completely solved the issue with lag and now also the web interface on port 3001 is showing up. For whatever reason, the ECO server does not pass data very well through a virtual bridged adapter. We have hosted other servers on this machine and have never had this issue.

community-help,wheat seeds? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/538/wheat-seeds,2196,3,3,Elliander,"Maybe the odds are just very low? I went and cut literally every edible plant I could find, and planted in an entire field, and always get less seeds than the total plants I started with. The odds of getting the potato equivalent is pretty high, but occasionally I won't get any seeds for blueberries or wheat at all and will be forced to venture out into the world to get more. Even with the farming skill at 25, I always eventually run out of seed. The odds of getting seed to replant should be an average so that you always end up with at least what you started with, or the crops will eventually deplete in a world completely. Or better yet, maybe the crop itself could be processed to get seed? I mean, a bulb could be split and planted as two. Blueberries can be dried to get multiple seeds. Wheat is a grain so each one should produce an entire plant that will have multiple grain."

I have no trouble building a workshop, but a house? Still can't do it. I put all this time into a detailed stone building, and made sure to make even the floor out of stone, and made sure no openings were taller than 2 blocks for doors, but still won't let me finish a house. I think the game is too rigid at this point in what it considers a house to be, when a roof, 4 walls, and a floor should be enough. I even tried embedded it into the ground to get around the whole only one floor rule (so I can build another on top later) but no luck.  Seen from the inside, I put an extra roof block layer down to conform to the 3 height rule, but it still won't see it as finished. I even tried filling in all the blocks, but no.  Then I tried leaving the blue print, going back in, and setting the boundaries on the inside (incase property rights in eco are weird and require the building to be outside the property line, rather than inside) and now it actually sees at least some blocks, but it thinks the area is not enclosed - even if I fill in all door ways.

He wants to set it up for us, instead of playing on someone else's server. That way we can all play together in our own fresh world instead of starting where it's half destroyed and mined out or pollution has already begun. We dont want to use a method that involves that port - forwarding stuff, He knows how to do that for other games but for this we'd rather find something simple if it exists. I'd be okay with a cheap server host that actually hosts servers specifically for this game, but unfortunately I can't find a single one. The only thing I could find was guides for using VPS, which I don't want to do because those are expensive, and we're really, trying not to spend money here. Is there any way at all to host maybe like, a local game using something like Hamachi? I've seen people say that they use hamachi to play with friends but I cannot find a how to anywhere for how to do that with Eco. It would need to be able to make it so he and I can play together, but also friends that aren't at our house being able to connect to our game as well. This would be the /most/ ideal way for us to play, we just can't seem to exactly figure out what the process is for making it work. Like what to use as an IP / Port after connecting through hamachi to get us all to connect to a single game.

Currently i have a Ubuntu vm running 14.04 and it hangs once it gets to the serialization step.

You can abandon the construction of a building if needed (misplaced, insufficient resources, mind change etc...) When you active the blueprint of a building the first thing to do it to define the place of the building by making 2 right clics: You have to respect some minimal space and the structural building grid with change to ""green"" once the minimal size is reached. Once the structural grid location is defined, you have to put a wood pillar a the third right clic of the building. This pillar symbolize the place of the ""special"" tool of the building (like the forge for the builder hut, the saw for the lumber mill etc...). You MUST not put it on a edge of the building (as you need to place wall here) so keep at at a minimal distance of 1 from the future side wall. The next step is to put wood or stone to define the walls, don't forget to leave a 1x2 (1 large and 2 vertical) hole for the door frame then to enclose the building by putting a roof. You have to fill the structural grid of the building (the fantomatic cube), in order to finish the building.

It works on other servers but not mine (had to get my server running via Hamachi in the end because even following all setup instructions and port forwarding - my .exe was having none of it). This problem happens to some of the friends I've had connect to my server but not all of them - so I assume my antivirus is blocking it or maybe it's a particular browser that won't load it - Using firefox atm.

I tried building a farm in 2 locations that both seemed adequate to me.
One a lot closer to water then the other one.
The one further away from the water seems to be growing the crops fine, though it takes a while before any of them are harvestable.
The other one close to water was unworkable though.
As soon as I put the seeds down on the tilled land they disappeared and brown blotches took their place.
What am I missing here? Greetz,

I didn't realise any different before this. Now maybe I should have read it more clearly, I dunno. I'm not mad - I'm happy that I can access the game and am very excited to play it. However, I would like to point out as feedback it would be nice if you stated in the purchase description that only the host of the 4-pack will receive the dev chat and dev tag features as I was not aware of this and the two other people I personally rallied to buy the game from my friend were under the impression they would also receive it because I missold the game based on my impression of what I thought all of us would receive. I doubt they'll be annoyed by the lack of those two features either and again, excited for the game - greatly appreciate the help from John, Jeff and NoBlackThunder but I would like the description updated to make it clearer to those buying that only the host receives those particular features."
