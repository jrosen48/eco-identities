community-management,Steam bundles? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5538/steam-bundles,8,2,1,JayD2point0,"Are there any plans of implementing bundled purchases of the game via Steam? I have quite a few steam friends that are interested in this game and I'd love to get it for them! However, I know that since they swear by the Steam platform, they'd be unlikely to give it a chance."
community-management,Steam bundles? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5538/steam-bundles,8,2,2,SLG-Dennis,"Hello,
Steam does no longer allow developers to sell bundles on steam since about two years. Only developers that already had a bundle were allowed to keep them.
We would gladly offer two and four pack bundles on steam - but this is simply no longer possible. You can still get the bundle on our website, invite them and then they can link their accounts to steam to also have it in steam. Sorry i can't bring you any better news."

Do you have some sort of format you wish to follow?  For example the ""axe"" needs revising, I was planning on just brain-dumping everything I knew about the ECO axe.  At what point is it considered ""done""?"
community-management,Eco: Global Survival Wiki Volunteer Team | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/312/eco-global-survival-wiki-volunteer-team,9450,18,6,dannypent,"There isn't any real format that ""Must"" be followed. The consistent format of which you are probably looking for has yet to be fully developed and has only just begun being integrated into the Wiki pages (i.e. eco.gamepedia.com/Builder's_Hut). These are still being finalized, however. Brain-dumping is perfectly fine. It is how we are leaving many of the pages right now and then will be going back through and cleaning them up once most of the general information has been written. The only thing we ask is that you proofread your work before posting. There are typos all throughout the wiki, but we will be combing through them to make the pages more professional as time goes on. 'Done' is a word that we cannot really use at this time. Having only the information from release V 1.0.0 to go off, we anticipate many changes to occur over the next year and a half of development. I do understand however what you mean :P Most pages can be marked as complete once images, basic information, detailed information (when necessary), redirects and proofreading has occured."

Now on a personal opinion ( remember it is my personal opinion and not reflecting the teams opinion ;) ) : A general schedule every Monday and try to post something meaningful is actually quite hard and most likely even quite time consuming. Time that can be better spend on making a game. I also personally believe in direct communications that a more 1 way like main page post.
Discord is a great tool to get directly and close to everyone while i feel that news post should contain larger info and updates instead just "" nothing new , just smashing bugs"" =) Facebook post do actually do show small progression and it is also easier this way, here we just post an image or a short video and a short line of text, Those come out at a random interval. All of this is easier for all of the team and us to get involved and we also get closer to people with direct communication. While updates on a main page are nice they should still only contain larger updates. That's at least my personal opinion and i think our discord is doing the direct communication thing very well =)"

I'd add a few here that are ideologically a fit to what i think Eco is trying to get across as well Ishmael by Daniel Quinn. A telepathic gorilla shares how human society got to where it is. Really fun read, hits on a lot of the concepts from the Kickstarter page Biogea by Michel Serres - more of an epitaph of ecology than anything else, it's a short inspirational read Cannibal Metaphysics - discusses the anthopological implications of the drastically different views of the world for tribes prior to colonial era (and some that exist today). Think Like a Commoner - dives not so deep but effectively into the lost concept of the commons and how the commons is still around even if the concept seems antiquated. The Power at the End of The Economy, by brian Massumi - While people believe that 'rational self interest' tends to govern economic matters, Massumi plays with this and pushes the idea that emotional choices have always been the hidden subject for those in economics. I really liked this and it's a fun read. How Forests Think - this, to me, is basically the ethos of Eco in book form. Totally worth a read. Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World  - a hugely influenctial book for my own creative thinking, the author argues - ehhhhh, let me steal from the amazon page: hyperobjects show that the end of the world has already occurred in the sense that concepts such as world, nature, and even environment are no longer a meaningful horizon against which human events take place. Instead of inhabiting a world, we find ourselves inside a number of hyperobjects, such as climate, nuclear weapons, evolution, or relativity. Such objects put unbearable strains on our normal ways of reasoning.Insisting that we have to reinvent how we think to even begin to comprehend the world we now live in, Hyperobjects takes the first steps, outlining a genuinely postmodern ecological approach to thought and action."

It is about remaking suburban and urban neighborhoods to serve people better and to reduce human impact on the environment. The authors first trace the history of the suburbs, showing how they fail to meet many peoples‚Äô needs. They then describe how existing neighborhoods can be transformed, offering cohousing and new urbanist communities as examples. The reader is then guided through the transformation of a fictitious neighborhood that adopts the authors‚Äô thirty-one steps. Ideas for the blossoming of the suburb are described in order of difficulty, from easy to boldest. The ""ecology of commerce"", by Paul Hawking (of The Rocky Mountain Institute... <3 )  may give you some ideas for developing a functional eco-economy, rather than having us try to force ordinary trading practices into a game that does not need them and are currently largely bypassed. And of course, the Grand Champion, ""Slow Money"" by Woody Tasch, is a must read for the locally-focused, eco conscious minds,  who wish to understand how to remake the world for local strength and resilience, using local food and fertility to drive local business."

(www.game-city.at / http://www.game-city.at/schultag) That would be a perfect spot to show this to schools in Vienna/Austria and the Austrian board of education.
And you may also show it in the Convention Hall to all the other commercial gamers.
Since I life there and love to go there, I would have no problems doing a little presenting there and show off the Game.
(I once did CM for a browsergame.. not very long but I got a peak and I know at least one Game-press in Vienna who would love that. And I did some promotions work .. (selling washing machines.. xD)) So if you want to go for Austria, you may want to consider that. For E3 how ever (must go) ... I'm from Austria, so Germany is up north.. yes but with train and all it's a long trip.. not that I wouldn't mind, I've never been there, but maybe some one from Germany wants to do that in stead?

I'm excited to begin working with you all on this extremely interesting project.  My name is Eli Levine, I have a Master of Public Administration and I am very interested in helping Eco become a fun game that's also a platform for social and ecological sciences.  I am doing my own research into Agent Based Modeling (ABM) and Socail Network Analysis (SNA) on the side.  I would love to help develop the definitions, metrics, and methods that could be used in Eco to gather data (anonymously) from players' actions and the aggregate conditions in game.  I believe this could advance our understanding about how economies, societies, governments, and other social systems evolve, adapt, and interplay with each other and the environments in which they exist.  I will warn you now that I don't have much of a coding background but I look forward to learning as time goes one. Looking forward to working with you all!"

This can be adjusted based on how they actually play the game based on their actions and choices in game (something like a multi-axis plane of personality types that they can drift around in). There is also the issue of the legality and ethics for conducting this kind of research and gathering this data.  I'm not sure if we need a sanction from a university's human subjects board to gather the data (something that I or someone with legal knowledge and experience can look into).  Either way, it's likely going to be a challenge to keep subjects ignorant of the possibility that they're being observed while playing the game and being ethical towards them as human beings.  Just another something for us to think about if we move forward on making this partially into an effective and ethical research instrument. I would also like to point out that I can only go as far as the social sciences are concerned.  I do not have the background in the environmental sciences to really comment on what good metrics might be for gauging the environments' conditions and how to gather that data.  I would recommend trying to recruit an environmental science expert and/or enthusist to help flesh this out.  Unfortunately, no one comes to mind on this front at present. That's all for now.

Specifically speaking i'm working on developing an engine that is somewhat karmic based where the players actions are accounted into the grand scheme of things and they'll see direct representation of choices/actions made reflected in the npc's around them and how the interact. I would love to get together sometime and compare notes as the basis for my research so far is  more steeped in how astrology/numerology plays into personality development and what archtypes that leads one to be most representative of.  In accordance i'm working on a world sim that incorporates these 'choices' and am developing a 'consequence oriented generator' that the world runs on.  A key component of what i'm envisioning / building towards is the fact that their will be a 'pre-screening' of player tendencies/choices similar to a psych analysis in order to best place them in a situation that they must evolve from/grow from. I mentioned it in my introduction that i hope to be able to bring some of this to the table and 'playtest' it here with ECO as i love their vision and what its going for as i hope to encapsulate something similar in the world sim i'm building.

I was thinking we can place the players randomly though to see how people behave and develop similarly to how people are randomly place on Earth. That way, people have to start wherever they start and do their best while enabling us to simulate human social and ecological systems as best as we can to allow people to self generate their civilizations and experiment with the same variety that real human societies have to work with. Hope this clarifies things for everyone. Cheers! @JohnK, I have some experience writing papers and would be happy to help produce some research. I think the key thing for us to do would be to define the metrics that we're going to look at and let the players play to see what emerges. I'll study nonlinear econometric techniques and how to analyze and interpret ABM and SNA simulations in the meantime. What are the grants for out of curiosity? Feel free to message me with the details. It may also help if we can get some real-world data to supplement the data. I've got some more thoughts on this though. Please keep in touch!"

General categories: Economy:
-Estimate total value of the economy in in game currency.
-Estimate/track where resources go in the economy through the inventories, stores, production centers, and assets of players
-Map out the economy geographically and in terms of production needs and trade (there's an excellent study called ""The Atlas of Complexity"" created by Hausman et al that we may be able to use). Society:
-Levels of education/skill achieved and maintained by players.
-Nutrition and ""health"" of players.
-Criminality (if we're able to include it).
-Initial psych screening and/or tracked choices to determine players' personality characteristics.
-Network analysis to seek clusters/groups and determine their traits. Politics:
-Require formalized rules per each society and track the dynamics and choices of the players within each system.
-Offer templates for governing and/or make them open ended to allow for innovation by the players.
-Rank and track players' satisfaction with their society and their governing system.
-Track the affects of policies on the economy, society, and environment using network analysis and discontinuity regressions.
-Score each society based on how they develop economically, socially, and environmentally. Technology:
-Track the development of technology and allow for a non-linear tech tree that allows people to progress in ways that may not match with our own present development.
-Track the overall trend of the technology development on the quality of life in the societies, economies, and environments.
-Allow techs to move around the shortcomings of older technology, such that problems with old technology can be mitigated or eliminated by future tech (with the possibility for problems to still remain sometimes). Environmental Science:
Unfortunately, I don't have the expertise on environmental science to know what is relevant and necessary for human survival beyond the need to clean up and dispose of certain waste products and not to deplete or excessively exploit certain raw material sources.  I would try to consult biologists and environmental scientists who specialize in the intersection of human activity and the environment to develop the metrics and possible studies here. These are just a few of the ideas that I've thought of and may (hopefully) be possible to do in Eco.  If I think of anything else, I'll post it here.  Feel free to add and/or subtract depending upon what's feasible, what's not, and what I've missed. Cheers!"

Items have no monetary value attached to them - so you would have to figure that out yourself. Players make up their own economy, with their own currency (if there would be one - it's entirely possible that the economy is based on goods trade all the way). I do understand that you want to gain some insights from this, and I usually love statistics, but I really hope that some of this stuff is opt-in, or not available on normal servers/outside of test groups. I'm fine with collecting passive data that does not require my input, but if I'm required to fill out questionnaires before I can start playing/every day after, that's a no-go. Plus, I see that there is a huge potential for abuse on public servers (i.e. ""see who's unhappy with the government and get rid of them"")."

The randomness means that it has an economically independent value like gold but it also has a natural deflation behaviour - if people get too many of them, they will burn through them trying to get a specific outcome from the random reward.
(Usually you end up stock piling them to get a 6-link but hey, I had ""too many"" when I burnt 300 fusing orbs that time.) The kind of thing they affect creates a natural hierarchy of denominations as well.

However, I am fairly interested in the environment, in multiple aspects (as I should be as I'm spending way to much money for a degree so I can work full time instead of summers only). ->Relevant/necessary for human survival
Food. Water. Shelter. In a more primal sense, what else do we really need? Food/Water are pretty obvious. Shelter being anything from a house or cave to clothing. Computers, cars, even electricity aren't really truly necessary other than we've lived with them for long enough most people can't go without it. ->Clean up and disposal of certain waste products
Pretty much anything we do should be cleaned up. I can't really think of any harmless waste we produce. Even bodily functions are now concentrated so much and mixed with who knows what else that you have something very toxic in the end. ->Deplete/excessive exploitation of ""certain"" raw material sources.
Sorry I take the keyword here as certain, but realistically any excessive exploitation causes issues. There's only so much mother nature can counteract. I know I didn't speak towards the game and what could be analyzed as far as it goes, but being that I haven't played it; it becomes more difficult to directly correlate. Personally, I'm probably going to do anything and everything I can to wreck the environment in game, just to see if it reacts as expected or if something weird-er happens. But back to the real topic. What I'd be interested in seeing more on (and tying back to those three points I took out):
-Species and extinction caused by our interactions (either through over-hunting; specific targeting [i.e. livestock protection]; or just what we do to the environment)
-Recovery of species (can we undo and help a population back to its feet)
-Deforestation and its effects, at that same time how much does our pollution increase due to every player murdering all the trees they can find.
-Mines - really produce multiple levels of pollution when its active its not so much the mine itself but the smelting process that destroys life, after its abandoned improperly you end up with acid mine drainage; water flows through dissolving various substances, direct effect being dropping the pH to more acidic levels (sometimes into the negatives), not much can grow in that but some plants can tolerate a fairly low pH. To bring people back into it: What do they do to avoid, counter, or mitigate these effects? Which has the ""best"" outcome? Was there resistance to the restoration projects or did everyone unite to bring it about? In my mind, its all limited by the software. Does it account for and react as it is known (or suspected) to in real life? Server size/composition - a group of friends on a 10 person server may be fairly similar in their want to keep x around so the spend all their resources to accomplish that goal; a server of 100 people none of them knowing each other there's bound to be resistance. And from a science standpoint, 100 ""random"" people make a far better study than 10 hand-picked. Just my thoughts. Should probably go back to trying to sleep again....."

I'm also thinking about tracking trade transactions, building construction, wealth distribution (in terms of currency and material goods), a method to track the laws that the society comes up with as well as a way to watch how these laws are created (this latter part is going to be trickier to see in game) as well as those environmental factors that you mentioned.  I can see a series of datasets being formed from each experimental server that can easily be merged together into one or more datasets.  @JohnK, I haven't had a chance to look at the code, nor can I really read the code.

the husbandry would be a separate skill from farming in that you have to capture and tame animals and pacify them for the good of the group.
the tame animals would have different laws than the wild animals and would be more beneficial than hunting but would have drawbacks so as to not rule out hunting.
there would have to be a way for the animals to breed such as a stables building
and a way to feed them maybe grains to feed.
if you gave each tame animal stats such as: weight, strength, produce  and fertility.
you could utilize the animals for things such as: plows, horses for transport, carriages/wagons for item transport, dogs were used for hunting, carrier pigeons were used for mail(rookery building?),"

I haven't seen a lot of games do this. So I wanted to tap the community for thoughts on the process and their experience: What open source projects have you worked on? Any games? What went well? What didn't?  What would you change?"
community-management,Running/contributing to an open source project | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/6/running-contributing-to-an-open-source-project,6388,17,2,MajorCyto_,"Well, i have only worked on open source projects but they were mostly related to WoW private servers as i used to be heavy into them and ran quite a big one (we won't go into the gray area on that lol). I have done a few of my own through repo's as well. This works a little different for us though, because unlike the other open source games anyone could git pull the source code.. While this is open source its only for people at a certain dev tier and above. So our repo's would need to private from guest access right away. Everyone else should get invited to make an account that can only make pull requests against the repo that need to be approved by strangeloop game devs before being immediately inserted into the code base. There is a bot integration add-on for slack+github which can notify in a channel of pull requests and new commits. The projects i worked on had well over a hundred volunteers and over a thousand pull request last i checked. It went well there, the system was merely what i explained above except there repo was also open to guests which ours cant be. Pull requests are our friend here, it lets the strangeloop devs test all the new commits first you should also hold up a code quality standard so the source doesn't get spaghettied. In the other project they would deny pull requests that did not follow certain code standards. Now you could choose to fix/pretty them up... or deny them and explain they need to clean up the code. Either way its important to have <u>commented</u> code base. Especially when you have volunteers...  I worked on MANGOS, TrinityCore, and ArcEmu. I didn't really have any bad experience except at first when they didn't used to fully test the pull requests and i would pull in bad code updates to my servers and have to revert or cherry pick out the commits that were wrong or fix them myself. Anything that comes out of master should just work. So really the only key things here is... We need to sign an NDA for code access, The repo needs to be private invite, Everyone should be required to do pull requests and have them approved by a strangeloop dev, And also all code should follow ""some"" type of standard you set up so the code base doesn't get all horrid and scary looking down the road. It took the TrinityCore project over 6 months to re-work the code base and fix it up to the standards they implemented later on. And that was fixing over thousands of commits. Also, Art Assets should be stored in something private like an OwnCloud so it can be on your own server, it can be private and you can set up accounts by invite. Then they can add a WebDAV disk to computer to access/sync the art from strangeloop."
community-management,Running/contributing to an open source project | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/6/running-contributing-to-an-open-source-project,6388,17,3,SketchBookGames,"My comment is about bug report process, which I suspect is important for modding and open source contributions:
Box2D has a testing sandbox.  As a developer, reporting a bug about Box2D works best if you can reproduce the bug in a simple form within their sandbox.
This process of reporting developer bugs seems to reduce the effort required by those who know how to fix the framework bugs.
The typical alternative seems to be, ""here is my pile of code, sometimes it does <something> wrong"" which will frequently result in finding a bug in the pile of code instead of a bug in the framework.  the developer would have likely found the bug in their own pile of code while simplifying the reproduction and porting it into the sandbox, without bothering those who know how to fix the framework bugs. <b>What went well</b>:  I bothered Erin Catto, Boris the Brave, and Jesse less often than i would have otherwise.
<b>What didn't</b>: The Box2D sandbox is a little daunting, because it too has unnecessary features when as it relates to reproducing bugs.
<b>What I would change</b>: It would be nice to provide a bare bones environment to reproduce and report bugs.  Perhaps even a ""level editor"" so that objects can be place in specific position to always immediately reproduce a ""sometimes"" physics bug."

We haven't got that many active projects yet, still early days. But some reflections on what we've experience so far: Have clear getting started guides (Even for some of the basics, if only a few links to better tutorials. Open source attracts people with all ranges of experience. It might some times seem like a hazzle to account for the people with almost not experience, but these people, enthusiastic people, can often be quick learners and a great asset if only they are guided a little extra in the beginning.) Clear style guides. (I see there are services one can hook up to perform analysis of code style that can help reduce some of the back and forth communication on this topic.) Clear branch guide. (Git-Flow or any other patterns) Clear guides for level of tests for each contribution."

I agree with the getting started guide as a lot of unity tutorial focus on using the unity interface rather than doing the same thing in code. The unity interface is great for something simple but quickly gets in the way if you ever what to do anything complicated. Git-Flow is great for mid to large teams and having one person responsible for taking a release cut might be a good idea too. Also bug reports should be easy to reproduce, with clear steps on how to reproduce."

The style guides also cover comments - don't repeat what the code says, describe the intent instead. For C++ we use Google's style guide: https://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/cppguide.html
For Ruby we use GitHub's: https://github.com/styleguide/ruby There are things in each I don't agree with 100%, but that doesn't matter - consistently does. The C++ style guide was inherited from the Google era of SketchUp so we kept when when Trimble acquired us.
We picked the GitHub Ruby guide because it was a commonly referred to guide among the community. Two familiar guides which increase the change that people have heard or even used them - less friction. Not sure what languages Eco uses across the board, but whatever the core team is already using is fine. Consistency is king. +1 for clear bug reporting guides. ""It does't work"" reports is notoriously time consuming to iterate over in order to get to the meat of the issue. Though, it sounds like the majority on this forum are existing devs, but if the bug tracker is opened to all users in general it might be worth some additional Report Bug tool on the website."

As someone who's spent more time just trying to figure out what a client even wanted to ask themselves vs making sense of what they already asked / reported an issue on, it can be a lifesaver if the bug report is well organized / has its own monitoring for control.  Especially if say a particular bug is reported multiple times across the board we would need to up its priority level of a 'fix' vs a bug reported only once. With that said i'm now even envisioning a means of 'up voting' or 'liking' on a bug if someone already filled out the details and you just need to re-iterate it when you came across it yourself (if it still not fixed yet)."

I'd been console only for years until I started a job at a place with 300 odd devs and GitHub enterprise. Here's some of the stuff we do... If it's GitHub then it's generally GitHubFlow, a variant of GitFlow which includes pull requests. Learn to rebase your local updates - it makes the history much more readable and will make your pull requests way smaller (when you encounter this pain, you will understand what I mean). <code>git rebase -i <target branch></code> will start an interactive rebase (the best kind) by bringing up a textfile with instructions - it's worth just trying it out and seeing what happens (with a test repo). <code>git rebase --ignore-date <current base branch></code> will rewrite all of your commits to now so they're all nicely grouped together in the history. A lot of people don't seem to twig that any git repo directory is a valid target for a remote - super handy for working on two versions of code or exchanging code without the rigmarole. It seems like GitHub Desktop is the GUI tool to use these days. GUIs help because they conventionalise merge, rebase and conflict commit messages. https://github.com/nvie/gitflow - the console tools for git (hub) flow by the guy who came up with it.
If you use this, you'll get automatic release notes simply through the way it integrates with Git's tag system and how GitHub presents them. https://github.com/GitTools/GitVersion - .NET tools for getting different formats of code version from the git history - super useful for CI Change your git text editor and diff tool to something you might actually want to use.
kdiff3 is decent and pre-configured if you're after a free diff tool. Get line endings sorted in a .gitattributes file and get a white-list style .gitignore because it is very hard to get rid of unwanted files once they make their way into the repo. PuTTY is pretty key in Windows for not having to enter the password for your ssh key all the time."
