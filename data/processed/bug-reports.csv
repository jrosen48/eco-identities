bug-reports,Alpha 5.5 Stable version Bugs | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1993/alpha-5-5-stable-version-bugs,27225,60,1,NoBlackThunder,"Howdy People! Can we try to post all new bugs here ? =) just to combine everything in to a single post and make it easier to find for future reference. This here will also count as a known bugs list for the latest release. Thank you all! some bugs i gathered so far ( i copy / pasted them from other post)  :
1.Tooltip hanging on screen is still here. (this is a pretty known bug) 2.Sometimes not able to see other people. Was standing in front of a friend and he couldn't see me (world border related?) 3.Animal carcasses de-spawning before you can pick them up. Two rabbits I killed de-spawned before I could grab the carcass. 4.Sliding. I keep noticing that often when I let up off the movement key that my avatar will slide a bit in a random direction. Edit: I've figured out what's causing it. If you stand alongside a surface as a wall or elevated ground and face it at sort of an angle then tap forward it will slide you along a bit. 5.Sometimes when I try to open a container it will open and then immediately close. Happens a few times before I can finally open it. ref for above bugs : http://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1986/bugs-i-ve-noticed-in-5-5 I have seen also some one complaining that stairs are not working. Can some one confirm this ?"

Whenever I try to go underwater, the picture freezes. By that, I mean I am able to move around, I can see my inventory and can tell my avatar is moving based on the coordinates but the visuals don't update. I see the horizon until I jump back out. It was working fine in version 5.4 and I often mined underwater. Now I am not able to do that."
bug-reports,Alpha 5.5 Stable version Bugs | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1993/alpha-5-5-stable-version-bugs,27225,60,5,MGrand3,"@NoBlackThunder #2 is likely world border related, yes Stairs not working is only with clambering turned off I believe. As for new bugs: #1 Logs on the ground disappear when walking over a world border. Doesn't seem to happen instantly, but if I bring 10 logs back across the border to my base and I come back, the log is gone, this has happened several times now. I believe this was an issue in 5.4 as well. #2 If you jump into/hug a wall, maybe specifically not full blocks such as glass, doors, brick walls, you can some times end up ""superjumping"" up them, regardless of height, and landing on top. Was definitely in 5.4 as well. To recreate, place a door and run into the outer edge of it so there's nothing above you. Should send you flying a few blocks up. #3 I've some times managed to replace certain blocks, specifically stone and dirt walls/floor in my houses with whatever block I have in my hand when placing them by mistake/in the wrong place. The block it replaces seems to disappear, though unable to recreate to test. #4 When you've felled a tree, cutting up the logs seems to make them move a lot more than usual, leading to more grass being turned to dirt, not sure if this is intended. #5 The Calorie Efficiency skill shows ""Current Level 0 (Next Level 0)"" for the upgrade. The actual upgrade is a decimal value, so I'm assuming that's just rounding it somehow? Should be a simple fix. Will add more as I find them."

When i try to go up some (usually between two walls) I can't get up unless I jump and have clamber on.

I have noticed that in 5.5 you can no longger make a running 2 block high jump. You no longer do this in 5.5 because the client slides down instead of making that last little push up. Could it be that the client character is now shorter then they once were.

(The client seems to be fine, but the server won't launch.) It appears to be related to bundling some of the libraries in the executable. Hopefully the switch to the .net core will resolve the problems we've been having with mono. Linux may be sitting the bench for a while, which is disappointing but understandable. These things can happen when making big changes that take time to implement.

Type of Feedback? (Should go in Thread Title) [Server Bug | Client Bug |Client Issue |Server issue | Enhancement | Suggestion]For now i think it would be nice that we post only bugs and issues with the game here, you can create feedback under the Ideas and feedback category, this way its easier to keep track of them and have a good overview Include recent Crash dump ( get only generated if the server crashes) Screenshots are also helpful if you can snag some. Video is even better. Happy hunting! ps: thanks to trance who helped simplify this post"

bug-reports,Computer turns off at random intervals. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5507/computer-turns-off-at-random-intervals,42,2,1,antaeus,"Re: ECO makes my computer randomly shutdown Hello, A friend of mine recently upgraded his computer. That involves new motherboard, CPU, RAM, PSU and graphicscard.
At random intervals of time, his computer shuts completely off. It does not make a crash log, since the computer is turned off. The event viewer just claims a loss of power really.
He can play Watch Dogs 2 and The Division 2 with no issue. Yesterday he tried playing Unturned, which is also made with Unity and that ran fine. During a Prime95 test his CPU came to max out at 82 degrees, which given, is quite high, but should not cause it to turn off. This issue if only happening when playing Eco. It has been tested with both the Steam edition and the edition that can be downloaded from strangeloopgames.com. The amount of game time he gets, varies from 5 minuttes til about 45 minuttes. He will try and run the game in a Linux enviroment on his computer for further testing. Any ideas as to how to fix this? Thank you in advance."
bug-reports,Computer turns off at random intervals. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5507/computer-turns-off-at-random-intervals,42,2,2,Kryzzk,"You don't state if he was playing ECO with no problems prior to the upgrade so I will assume that he was. I would start by watching the heat of the CPU and GPU as well as making sure that the PSU has enough power to run everything at max. A lot of newer computers will power off if they get to hot, I have had games like ARK, cause a reset when the graphics card got too hot, ECO is more optimized than ARK but has Far more calculations to keep up with. Also if the PSU gets overloaded (components drawing more than its max power) that can cause a reset too, there is also the possibility that he has a faulty component, just because it was new doesn't make it 100% working. He could also try putting the computer back the way it was and see if the problem is still there, if not, then upgrade one piece at a time until he finds the part causing the problem, but my guess is over heating or the power supply is too weak for what he has. Games like watchdogs and The division are not really a good comparison to games like Eco, the environment of those games isn't as demanding on the RAM and GPU as they don't have destroyable worlds, I don't know about unturned as I have never played it.  ECO does have a 100% destroyable world, as a result there are a lot more calculations that must be maintained by the computer also the amount of the calculations will changed based on what is loaded in the ""chunks"" that are currently loaded, an area of the map that has not been touched by a player will have far fewer calculations than a chunk that has been leveled out and has 10 factories making stuff."

OS/Web Browser? Chrome. Detailed Description of Issue: When running for office, I cannot vote for myself or any other candidate.  Trying to do so results in the error message in the title and my vote not being tallied.  Note that I can run for office just fine, as well as propose and vote on laws.  Only attempting to vote during an election causes this error. Reproducible? How difficult is it to reproduce? This happens every single time. Steps to reproduce bug/issue: Attempt to vote in an election. Additional Comments: This is a pretty rough bug, since it means I can't meaningfully participate in voting for the leader of our small server.  Any kind of workaround or solution would be appreciated. Client Version? [Alpha .01 for example] 0.8.1.4"

We checked and found this.  We have absolutely no idea how this happened. But whenever we move a block under or adjacent to water, the water won't fill the void. No matter what we do, the water won't flow. We even tried to move it using aqueduct-blocks, but that won't work either."

My food multiplier is stuck and does not change no matter what I eat. No actions I have specialized in give any skill points, there is no pop up graphic and the number of exp in the skill remains unchanged. I have tried logging out and restarting and the server owners tried to fix it but can not find what is wrong. Please let me know what other information I can provide which might be of use. Thanks"

No doubt it's a matter of bad optimization. This has been the pattern with every major content update but usually they manage to improve performance with the next few patches. Hopefully this time it will be the same, and by 8.1 or 8.2, performance will be back to where it was in version 7 or better. Also, the devs have explicitly stated that 8.1 is going to focus on performance."

bug-reports,Game is unplayable after update 8.0 | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5313/game-is-unplayable-after-update-8-0,276,4,1,Durovenia,"I play Eco together with my brother. For me Eco is just running fine, but for my brother it is not anymore. Currently he is only able to play the game at 12 FPS or lower. When he harvests something, FPS drops as low as 3. I suppose the game got a major graphics boost, but I thought his laptop would still be able to run the game just fine. He plays from a i7 laptop with 12GB RAM, nvidia gt540m (1GB) and Intel HD 3000. He should be able to run the game right? Or did they increase the minimal requirements to 1.5GB GPU?"

Maybe you should give them a refund for taking that away from them.

Also, we're working on most issues that are bugs, but in every game - especially early access you need to know that system requirements are likely to increase and that playing with a machine that is at the lower point of the minimum specs might not be working forever. Take a look at this screenshot and how Eco improved - this is impossible to do without raised system specs."
bug-reports,Cart - Linked inventories bugged | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5312/cart-linked-inventories-bugged,35,1,1,Exzentrik,"Hi, something is wrong with the way, accessable inventories are listed when accessing a Cart.
This can show in two different ways: First, when I access a Cart I see the Stockpiles and Chests in the near vacinity. Everything is fine. But when I then move the Cart far, far away and access it again, I can still access the Stockpiles listed first. The Second occurance is, that the list is not getting updated when Accessing the cart, at all. I moved the cart into my mine, standing now right next to a Stockpile.... and it's not listed when Accessing the Cart. This only occurs when accessing the Cart itself. When accessing Stockpiles or chests, the Carts and Wheelbarrels only show, if they are actually near them."

I can drag road tiles from this far-away stockpile into my wood cart. The access to the far-away stockpiles doesn't happen anytime - i don't know which circumstances lead to this malfunction. It just seems, only the stockpiles are shown, that were in range, when i last looked into the cart (when i was on my property). Edit: Also, it is possible to move items between the shown far away storage units (so from one stockpile to another or to a chest). This behaviour is just like being normal at the range of the storage units."

But all types of Carts, you can use to transport stuff, pull vanishing acts on me. Every time I leave the chunk or whatever it is the game uses to determine the rendered Area, and return, my carts are gone.
When I access a nearby stockpile I see them listed and can access their storage. But I don't see them.
Other players can see them and I'm told, I push them around when I run into them. So they are definetly there... they are simply not getting rendered."

bug-reports,Skill gain bug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5275/skill-gain-bug,137,3,1,manticorex,"Hello Guys, i have a problem with the new skill system. Every time i pressed the ""Mouse_key_2"" (right_click) i gain a certain amount of xp. The problem is, players on the server yould just stand and look on the ground an press the mouse button to gain xp. I edited the config files and set the option: ExperiencePerAction = 0.1
I also know that this is very experimental but a player should only gain xp if he/she would perform any action which makes sence. The same goes for if i equip a shovel and look to dirt and press ""Key_e"" (E) on my keyboard. Version of Eco: 8.0.1 and also testet with 8.0.0 I attached a screenshot! Thank you. "

I am throwing this post up because I noticed that there was an issue with Ore Generation if you are using a world bigger than 200x200 and the patch apparently was supposed to fix the issue? So the world was updated to the current generation segment. However, I am finding that we STILL cannot find Ores in the areas surrounding where we were digging in the ground. Do we have to travel out a ways and then start digging? Thanks!"

This was right before they released the new update the fixed the 200x200+ worlds (Or at least it was SUPPOSED too as far as I understood) and thus far have still been unable to generate it. Can anyone else confirm whether or not the resource generation has been fixed and if so, how to get this fixed on our server? I noticed that when it started up, we had to wait for the world to regenerate into the new world format so I thought for sure that this would start the generation of ore, etc. I hope this is fixed soon. I would rather NOT have to restart again. And to be honest, if it doesn't get fixed and I have to generate a new world, I do not know how many other of my community members as well as some of the public members also playing on will continue to play. It is getting quite frustrating that this is currently happening. Thanks"

At 180 its unplayable, at 140 its playable but irritating, and at 100 its STILL laggy but mostly just when traveling. I dont think this has anything to do with my computer being able to handle the game since there wasnt any lag before the update.

bug-reports,Can't Get Past Start Screen | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4626/can-t-get-past-start-screen,1416,8,2,ShaydenMac,"You now use your gameport instead of webport to connect, so if you used to connect to port 3001, you would now use 3000 if you used default ports. If creating a standalone server on a machine with the client-server already installed through the game, you have to use ports other than the default, perhaps 4000 and 4001, although you always use 2999 as the listening port and share with the client.  You may have to check out your support pages for your ISP to learn about your router or google your router make and model for a manual to read information about port forwarding.  Usually, your ISP support site will have information on port forwarding for your modem/router. If the router is not from your ISP or they do not have that information for you, there are many guides online about how to do this, and it is a relatively easy process. Next important thing:  If your server's not showing up, you need to go into appdata/LocalLow/Strange Loop Games/ and delete the Eco folder then restart Eco and it will write new files.  To get it to populated you may need to open the filter (middle button between search and refresh) and click 'apply'."

Someone please help me, if needed i can send the save or make a video or whatever, i'd rather not throw the last 20 or so hours ive happily spent so far in this game. all the other game breaking bugs i've been fine with, theres usually a solution, but this time it seems terminal."
bug-reports,Massive drop in skill point from housing | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4685/massive-drop-in-skill-point-from-housing,1089,9,2,Eprisable,"I have not played for long, just placed my first butcher table. I play single player and have 'gain skillpoints on crafting' enabled. Today i am not gaining skillpoints for crafting.  I only have a kitchen and the furniture dont ad points to the room. This is just in a starting place. i have not even build a house yet.
Also to unlock my next recharch (planning tailor) i need 500 points!! If i remember correctly, the recharch before was 0 points to start.
If i don't get skillpoints for crafting and i need 500 points to get the next recharch, im not going to be able to destroy the meteor. Edit:
i have messed around with stuff and i fixed the furniture. kinda weird tho. My butcher table works everywhere in the house but only on several places it gives house points. i changed nothing about the house ( 1 room 273m3), never ""broke the room"". Also the furniture only works in several places. even tho a buther table will work (everthing is green but not giving house points) if i place a chair on that spot it won't give points. but moving around with stuff i got it now from 2 to 7.1. But im very confuzed how it works, i cannot place anything against the walls for house points, i checked its not blocked. also some places a bit from the wall does not give the points.
Still not gaining crafting points and for the next recharch i need 500 points, altho i have seen video's other people playing single player and they unlocked much more then me and still had o points to unluck. (these vids where before the update). last update:
The reason my house points where funky was because i forgot to claim the land! woopsie, sorry.
I did unlearn like 4 specialty wich gave me just around 1000 skillpoints lol. (half of the cost i never put in) so i could unlock tailor, messed around a bit. Went explore the world and lots of places half off the plants where dying. :(
For some reason my world changed to multiplayer set up with no craftingpoints after the update. Btw i have the game on steam with auto update.
I made a new world and now the skillpoints works correct."

Usualy, when you put a ramp while standing on the ground where you want it to be, you're just pushed up. Same for dirt you put under your feet.
But sometimes, you're stuck under and the game can crash. Then you can't reconnect to the server because your character is still blocked and the game crash again and again.
Not the first time it happens to me. Last time it made the whole server to crash definitely. It was with dirt ramp. This last time was with stone ramp. I'm waiting for my friend to discard the ramp I'm stuck under to see if I can reconnect. The server is the 46.251.235.98:5601"

If not, see below. You now use your gameport instead of webport to connect, so if you used to connect to port 3001, you would now use 3000 if you used default ports. If creating a standalone server on a machine with the client server already installed through the game, you have to use ports other than the default, perhaps 4000 and 4001, although you always use 2999 as the listening port and share with the client.  You may have to check out your support pages for your ISP to learn about your router or google your router make and model for a manual to read information about port forwarding.  Usually your ISP support site will have information on port forwarding for your modem/router. If the router is not from your ISP or they do not have that information for you, there are many guides online about how to do this, and it is a relatively easy process. Next important thing:  If your server's not showing up, you need to go into appdata/LocalLow/Strange Loop Games/ and delete the Eco folder then restart Eco and it will write new files.  To get it to populated you may need to open the filter (middle button between search and refresh) and click 'apply'."

This breaks lots of different ways of directing traffic to the webserver (DNS, for instance, or anything over a NAT), and should be configurable--if it is already configurable, then it should be mentioned somewhere.

Dont really know what else to say.. picture below shows what I'm referring to. UPDATE: we've just found a desert turning to dirt too. in most cases it appears to be spreading from the water (both river and ocean) - in the picture already attached you can see both cases of this UPDATE 2: there appears to be a bug with the trample spread - if you watch the relaps on the server, it spikes on day 4. going to put report on gitgud. http://78.129.212.51:10615/index.html? for those that want to see - look at trample spread on cause & effect "

bug-reports,Cave Exploit | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4441/cave-exploit,428,1,1,Achlys1775,"When playing, if you build a workshop against the opening of a cave, it counts the volume of the cave towards the workshop's space.  As a result, I'm able to place 10 workstations side by side in a very small space while coring out a mountain.  It saves me the trouble of having to build an actual building.  Is there any way to assess what the walls are made of and then, if they are raw, unprocessed logs (like dirt or stone) then they count against the building?  Or is this intentional? Thanks!"

The issue happens on client - server! Upon placing a road ramp - asphalt (I was staying on a block where it was to be placed), my character got instantly teleported to location interpreted as (-2147483648, -2147483648, -2147483648) - e.g. 0xFFFFFFFF in hex in all coordinates - literally placed to negative infinity. I suspect there might be some division by zero and improperly handled conversion of numbers after. Upon disconnecting and attempting to reconnect to the server, I'm stuck at 'Entering the world' phase. I'm attaching an image how it looked like:teleported to infinity The problem can be solved by teleporting back to other player or to specific coordinates. If by any chance you have disconnected from the server and didn't teleport (in which case you won't be able to connect anymore), restarting a server will solve the problem by placing you to spawn My hardware configuration:

GPU: AMD Radeon Rx 480 To replicate: We were able to replicate it multiple times by placing Asphalt ramp (4x4 one) under yourself or under my friend. We tried it few times and it was kinda funny bug in the end. E.g. one player stands at location where ramp is being placed either by himself or by another player.

I love the game! I supported it last year and love to see the game growing. Now I do have a question about the Alpha Rewards. I have these in one server I made in single player mode (1-3 players) but this was just a test. I am playing on public servers now, but in none of them I seem to have the Alpha Rewards. I tried making a new game again and still had no luck. Maybe it is because I linked the game to steam? Or is it because I bought a few new upgrades. However, is there a way to fix this.
Thanks for this amazing game!"

It's when the leader of the world set negative taxe that cause bug. When someone buy in your store with a currency who havn't Tresory, the negative taxe agree him to pay less money.
So when no Tresory in the currency , if people buy for more that they have money, everything become free for them. Ex: Player A have the store. And player B have 50 $. A glass is selling 1 $ in the shop.
If  player B bought to player A for 60 glass (so for 60$, more money than player B have)  so player B take the 60 glass free and give no money to player A. So negative taxe in a currency who havn't tresory make that bug when player try to buy more than they have money."

the game did not crash, it was still opnened at load (trying to load did the same thing).
tried every version, all the same.
I have Win 8, but the bug seems to occur for every OS. found a Crash dump it created, but I seem to not be able to open it. i also tried installing a cracked version to find out if it was steam just not installing a file, but all of them did the same. so the problem is probably in peoples computers."

bug-reports,Very annoying bug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4324/very-annoying-bug,592,2,1,GnomeLoli,"I was playing yesterday night on a private server with friends and after a while we decided to call it a night.
Next morning I wanted to go check on my craftings before going to work but I couldn't connect back to the server. In fact, I couldn't even connect to any server nor create a singleplayer world.
Everytime after trying to connect it would just tell me ""Connection failed"". I've tried everything in the book to fix this issue, even with the help of a moderator and the lead moderator of the discord without any fix. They told me I would have to make a bug report for it so here we are. We are on  7.2.4, everyone else in my group can join the server no problem while I'm no longer able to. Not only that but nothing changed between the time I was on yesterday and now (no server reset / computer reset, at least until we tried fixing the issue) We tried updating the server to 3.1 but it still doesn't work for me. Please help, we were having a blast with the game until it became unplayable!"

You have to do a very clean install  Its really important to do all these steps.  First if you have an singleplayer saved games go to your steamlibrary common/Eco/Eco_data/Server/Stoarge and save the worlds there bith the .eco and .db files.   then right click on Eco in steam and do an uninstall.  Then shut steam down and go back to steamlibrary common.and delete anything of Eco left behind.  Then yo to appdata/LocalLow/Strange Loop Games/ and delete the Eco folder.  Then start steam back up and install Eco. [HINT: appdata is in your Users directory usually like Users/<machine name>/appdata its a hidden directory so you will have to tell windows to let you see it] That should, hopefully get you a working  version.  You may ahve to double check that Eco is still  listed in your firewall and in your AV program as an exception"

bug-reports,Water doesn't pool | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4298/water-doesn-t-pool,633,4,1,freschmeet,"Server, Client or Website? OS/Web Browser? Detailed Description of Issue:
I spent a few hours building a dam to create a lake, but the water does not pool properly. I've checked every square yard/meter/foot/block of surface within the ""lake"" I had hoped to build, and there are no empty spaces for water to escape, so I cannot understand why the water is not pooling. Reproducible? How difficult is it to reproduce?
Simple to reproduce - try to make a pond or lake. It doesn't work. Steps to reproduce bug/issue:
Find flowing water source. Build dam. Water keeps flowing through it. Additional Comments:
Is this intended performance? I noticed a post elsewhere that ""Since BETA 7.2 the functionality of aqueducts has been disabled for performance reasons. Currently, there is no way for the player to influence the moisture value of a ground block."" - does this limitation also restrict the manipulation of water in the world? Server, Client or Website?

I could offer you German... Your Game.eco may be corrupted. You can open it by renaming it to Game.zip to check integrity.
In case it is corrupt I hope you have still access to the backups - standard is every 4 hours therefore you would have lost 2 hours. I had no such incident by myself therefore I have no experience to offer.
Check out backup files for server ? how do you use them ? and a detailed answer in Server population at 0 after server restart. Btw Steam tool EcoServer is exactly the same as in [Path]\Eco\Server\"

bug-reports,Campfire can't cancel/collect | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4254/campfire-can-t-cancel-collect,417,2,2,Thineboot,Campfire costs Stone and Log. You can Carry either Stone or Log but not both at the same time. That's why you can't cancel the order. You can link your Workbench to a Stockpile. That way you could cancel the order as long as the linked Stockpile has enough free space to accept the Stone and Log. If you have no stockpile yet or if it's too far away you can give yourself one using Chat >> /give stockpile - as long as you're in single player or being the admin of an online server. You could also try to link your workbench with your chest. That way the campfire should be transferred into the chest automatically. If you're a normal user logged into an abandoned world were none except you is playing you may wanna invite someone to join you and help you out. If neither works be assured that you're not the first one who discovered this bug ;)

We can do it in real life, why not in Eco? You don't have to make them disappear, rather make them land on the ground like litter in real life. Other people could then walk by and pick it up. Either way, if I want to pick up a shovel of Iron ore but on the way to the cart I see an Elk and need the meat more, I should be able to just drop whatever...  Okay, so the shovel of ore is a bad example, how about I have too many ferns or whatever... There's no reason why I shouldn't be able to drop them."

bug-reports,Drop Items aka Litter | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1074/drop-items-aka-litter,10707,8,3,Freds00n,"Will probably be featured in the following alpa's ; same for item splits. The UI is in place but it just doesn't work.
Easy solution for your problem: bring boxes 24/7 and loads of them and just put all the stacks in boxes. My eco breakfast: eat a pie, eat a sausage, craft 10 boxes. :D You sort of need to make priorities as well; or you collect ore or you hunt elk i mean... Ore doesn't add weight (yet? - anything in your hand - even tools) so in the first place you shouldn't be able to get the carcass and the arrows anyway because they are too heavy already (so you could potentially carry less ore - which is the thing you came for in the first place) . Even if you have arrows/bow with you, you can just drop of the items in the nearest storage box you've put down to assist in mining. You'll be able to get a stack of 10 instead of doing 1 by 1's all the time, much easier and faster. Then carry them to your cart (which should be next to the box - extend the road! You can open two inventories and put all the items from the box into the cart instead of doing it by hand). Also; if your inventory is full of trash (deeds, dirt, seeds,...), just dig a bunker underneath your house (dig deep and create small rooms) and put chests in there. Just dump your stuff in there. I've created walk-in bunkers and drive-in bunkers so far - it's not that hard. They both were for taillings so you will have to carry these quite a lot. So a 'drop everything' feature isn't really necessary at the moment but it's needed in the future indeed, especially for people to pick things up - but then again you can use boxes and unclaimed land to 'drop things'."

Still hoping that this  thread in the bug report category will find some attention at least. Unfortunately no developer has ever given support for this bug. It already seems to be over 4 months old (looking at other threads for this topic). Here the further description of my problem: I went through it again. I can start the server itself from the above mentioned location. (See above link to the other thread I pointed at) I can run it as administrator or without, it always successfully starts a server.I also found a log file in the ECO server directory that states that the server ""Initialization finished in 107.659,4ms"". That and the fact that I can then take a look at all settings and stuff for the server (even map layers and so on) shows that the server itself is running. Seems to be a GUI related problem (or however you would say that in gaming language). Somethings off with the GPU stuff. Last time I had a problem like that was with the horrible NFS Most Wanted reboot from 2012, downloaded from Origin. Worst 5 bucks I've ever spent. Turns out it doesn't support anything that has more than one GPU in it. (google: NFS most wanted will not launch) That were the most annoying 2 afternoons+evenings I ever spent on troubleshooting a game and the first time it absolutely did not run. F*** EA for not caring at all. I'm drifting off. sorry."

This is where I changed ""Aspect ratio"" to ""No scaling"" on the Adjust desktop size and position page (with ""perform scaling on Display""). With my setup it was also connected with the following:https://forums.geforce.com/default/topic/547415/nvidia-control-panel-missing-options/ ...which was caused by my laptop having 2 GPUs as described before. I had to deactivate the ""hybrid graphics mode"" in the BIOS to ""discrete mode"", so my laptop would exclusively work with my nvidia quadro M1000M.

There is an issue where a project is created from any type of workstation where sometimes the project becomes stock with the following details, Job: Done - Time: 100% Resources 100% Yet no work is outputted into stockpiles and/or chests. These workstations normally have many linked stockpiles and chests, and yes, there is room in these chests. The items are just not being outputted sometimes. It does not matter if it is a small job for 1 item or a large job for 500 mortared stone. The jobs can become stuck and the only way to clear the workstation is my cancelling the project. Which deletes all resources used to make the item as well as the end product. You lose everything. It has become such an issue that our server has resulted in people not putting projects in workstations for more than a handful of the item at a time because the chance of encountering this bug and having all your resources deleted seems to be 50/50 at this rate. The only thing we can think of that might be causing the issue is that there are too many stockpiles and chests in range of the workstation, it does not seem to matter if they are linked (ticked) or unlinked, simply being in range of 5+ chests/stockpiles/torches (anything with an inventory) seems to create the bug. We will be trying to repo this with just 1 single chest and stockpile in range of the workstation and see if that fixes the issue but either way, this is a major issue! There is currently a bug report for it on their GitHub, but it sadly has no repo steps and does not seem to be noticed by the developers at all. URL: https://github.com/StrangeLoopGames/EcoIssues/issues/5929 If you have encountered this issue, please try post repo steps and please promote the issue on github to get the developers attention. "

But in my situation, if I set the Multiplier to 100, the food will give 200.000 SP and the house only 800 SP... So I created a new house with 5 rooms und some furnishers, I get a room sum of 16 und a room balance of 1...
Let's say I use the best objects und best balance (this would be a huge house), I don't know the numbers, but let's say:
room sum: 100
room balance: 2
SP for house: 200House With Multiplier: 20.000 SP
Food with Multiplier: 200.000 SP You see, the difference is too big, isn't it?

Its also stated that the SP generated by Housing is having a limit. As soon as you add more furnishings like 2.5 per Room. It gets a decent bonus. On my Server with a SPM x3 you generate about 110-130 SP per Day if well feed. My house is generating additional 51SP per day (avg. room value is 2.73). So its almost 40%.

Client Version: 6.4.2 alpha
os:Win7
Detailed Description of Issue:
After starting a new game with the latest download 6.4.2 for both client and server, i started collecting resources, i built a campfire and put down the workbench after selecting some basic skills.
Once i had a few turkey's (6) i went to cook them but the option to cook turkey was not lit up.
I thought i might not of selected the wrong skill so i went to the wiki and it says the campfire basic cooking is under survivalist, so i looked, no campfire option at all. I looked under chef and there is campfire with all the options.
so i made a new campfire in the workbench and put it down still no cooking recipes available except making torches. I think basic campfire is under the wrong menu (chef) and the basic recipes are not being given when a campfire is made in the workbench. Linrox"

I thought since it went from fullscreen to my desktop, I'd try to have the game set on windowed mode so I did so and then tried to create a new world and after starting to load something it went straight to just the forest ""background"" of the game start screen then I pressed escape and it went back to the main menu. I tried using windowed mode to join a server and the game just crashes. I just got the game last night and had no trouble installing it, the game runs at 60fps just fine so I don't think its a problem with my laptop. Let me know if there's anything I can do to fix this other than waiting for another patch or full release."

bug-reports,Game will not launch with active internet connection | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3792/game-will-not-launch-with-active-internet-connection,510,1,1,xcrankshotx,"Good Evening, So I promise this is my last resort! I admittedly did a quick glance over the forums to see if anything has come up similar, but after 3 hours of google, not a single match has come up. I even tried other forums with different games where people had a similar issue but no luck. I purchased Eco through steam, and it was running great until last night. In steam while connected to the internet, the game will launch for about a half a second and then will disappear. Steam says the game is running, but my PC does not detect an instance of Eco anywhere. It only does this for Eco ( i have 100+ games that have no problem) I have to task manager close steam and disconnect my internet and start in offline mode, and then launch the game. I can resume internet and the game will run just fine. I have tried disabling the antivirus i have, I have disabled my firewall, everything. The only think i can think is that the game has some sort of ""tunnel adapter"" on startup and my PC does not like it. Any thoughts? Thanks! Best Regards,
Harrison"

bug-reports,Game using 100% GPU | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3745/game-using-100-gpu,1812,7,1,Killertortilla,This isn't so much a bug as a performance issue. My card is a Radeon R9 280X and every time I load the game it jumps straight to 100% usage. Surely a 256mb game shouldn't be using all of that.

Then started Looking all over Google and the forums could not see anything. Only every telling people that they need to check Ports  and blaming their hardware ( that is why I said i'm and Engineer I knew it was not the ports ).  Then thought I will download 6.0.2 as it might have a fix guess what nope. so i started looking at the configs then I tried this below ""here is probably all you want to know The Fix"" Fix / Bug:
Setting server to private with a white list locks the hole server out If you want to have it kinda private the best way i have found it take the server off the List under Network Tab Public Server = False But make sure you leave the Private Server = False You will not be able to find the server in the list, but you can give your Friends your IP and it will work wonder Hope this helps every and the devs read this."

My username is ""egburr"" but while the steam link was down some days ago, when I logged on a user ""egburr#2"" was created. Every time I have logged on since then, I have had to select which one I want to use when I connect to this server. From the messages, it looks like this is related. This error pops up at the point where I am expecting the user selection pop-up to appear. Also, I don't know if this is related, but AVG Anti-virus is occasionally popping up that it has protected me from URL:Mal.

Nothing here in the ""how to report a bug"" says report there only.  It just states that I ""can""  not that I must, so it is not clear if your goal it to only report via GitHub.  I don't have a GitHub account and quite frankly don't choose to get one to report the bug there, instead of here.   This is where I was directed to go, this is your bug report forum, and to direct me to an outside site to report the bug there seems a bit much.   So as much as I would like to help, no.

But with my issue that I'm having in 7.0.8 and any 7 series is that my emblem next to my name is stuck in silver. My character starts with rewards of top hat and meteor shard and what not, but that emblem stays silver. Heres the thing, every friend I've given a copy to is gold status, so I'm just wondering why mine is stuck at silver, and the extra copies I got with my pack are gold status.  Tried different worlds, launched through steam and the download from the site and both are stuck at silver. I know this isn't really anything important but I'm just wondering why it's doing this to me when I bought the extra copies package and all of them are gold. Idk just thought I would deserve the gold status for it or vice versa, them being silver and my gold? idk anyone else having this issue or recommendation to see if a dev knows whats going on with this?"

Changing windows from a separate item that could be placed to be using the hammer to ""create"" a window spontaneously is something which was just introduced in the last update. IMHO it was a really bad idea and incredibly confusing from a user interface perspective.  I could offer criticisms of the system so far as it is far from intuitive and adding complexity where it isn't needed.  It doesn't help the core game.... at.... all.  It may help so far as making it easier and cheaper for non-carpenters to be able to add windows earlier to their houses, but again... what does that solve?  Making carpenters more useless and removing specialization doesn't seem to help either from what appears to be a goal of encouraging more specialization of players on a server.

It's one where; when you shift-click to select the amount of an item you wish to drag into your inventory, it puts double that amount in, and that items icon will just hover in the center of the screen, and the amount taken from the main stack will still only be down the regular amount you had asked for. If you try and drag the icon out from the middle of the screen and put it back into your inventory, it instead goes missing and removes the extra amount that it took out too-- meaning that what you originally had tried to move out of the stack, plus the weird doubled glitch amount is now completely nonexistent and gone entirely.
It happened to me with tomatoes; I had a stack of 100 and another unrelated stack of 72 tomatoes. I tried to take out 29 and remove it from the stack of 100 with the shift, left click command- it, instead, added 58 and left behind 42, but also left the tomato icon in the middle of my screen. When I grabbed and dragged it into my inventory, it vanished along with the 52 tomatoes.
I'm not exactly sure what happened, but I hope the description might help recreate the issue for someone else to see and hopefully fix."

I will continue to slide for a bit as if I am on ice. Sometimes i will also slide up the wall as if I am climbing (I have clambering set to off btw). I think it is dependent upon what direction I am walking in relation to the wall.

bug-reports,Weight Coal | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3122/weight-coal,563,2,1,GhostRat,"I tihnk coal should be not so heavy. Better give it the same wight as stone. 1 coal 30 kg
1 stone 7 kg"
bug-reports,Weight Coal | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3122/weight-coal,563,2,2,Aether,"Coal is actually significantly less dense than most other stones (aprox. half as dense), and realistically should weigh less than stone at the same volume. Some example densities for comparison:
(source https://www.thoughtco.com/densities-of-common-rocks-and-minerals-1439119) Coal	1.1 - 1.4
Limestone	2.3 - 2.7
Granite	2.6 - 2.7
Shale	2.4 - 2.8
Hematite (Iron)	5.26
Copper	8.9
Gold	19.32 So, realistically, at the same volume of material, you should be able to carry twice as much coal as stone. (and half as much iron as stone, about a quarter as much Copper, and an eighth as much Gold) This does assume purity of material; Iron, Copper, and Gold ores would likely have a mix of impurities, such as regular stone/minerals in the Ore; but I don't know how much of difference that would make. This seems like a good rough estimate for added realism, without overly complicating things. At some point, a re-balance of all stone/ore weights to be more in line with realistic densities would be a good idea."

A better solution would be the cart parking suggestion where players can lock thier carts into place to prevent them from flying off all over the place.

bug-reports,Alpha 6 Broke (Almost) Everything | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2889/alpha-6-broke-almost-everything,813,1,1,Micro753,"So, Alpha 6 seems to have broken just about everything. First bug we came across was a duplication bug. If you link a stockpile to a crafting bench and order something you don't have the resources for, then place a stack of a resource you need, quite often the stack would disappear from the stockpile with a message that it was added to the project, but then reappear a split second latter and repeat the message and reappearance, etc. It could go on indefinitely (I once had it happen for a 5 minutes until the project had all the resources needed) if you move around while it is happening. Not sure if it would be a problem with client or server side, but it happens on every server I've been on and to other players as well. Next bug is one where weight isn't removed from your inventory when you sell items at a store. Also, sometimes weight would be added to your inventory when you fail to buy items from a store, such as not enough space, carry weight, or money. This ghost weight is fixed only from a server restart, and again, it has happened to everyone on our server. Yet another bug is also related to shops. I brought a large cart with me because i was going to buy gold ingots to make more currency to put in circulation. First, i tried to buy 50, but didn't have enough carry weight, so, because of the previously mentioned bug, my inventory was ""full"" even though i had nothing in it. I decided to try and link the cart directly to the shop instead, and that worked at first. I bought 17 ingots, and they were put in the first slot of the cart. I then bought 100, the shop took the money, the ingots disappeared from its inventory, but didn't appear in the cart. The cart did add the correct amount of weight to it as if the ingots were added, giving it ghost weight just like my inventory had. Lastly, we had an issue where moving the mint to a different spot in the same room on the same property caused me to be unable to make more of the currency. When I typed in the name of our currency, it just created a new one with an identical name, and I can only make more of and edit the name of the new currency. Performance also seems to be significantly worse than previous alphas. If you want logs from the server, you'll have to contact the server owner. I'm not sure who that is, but the server is the Dark Cubes server. You can find a link to the discord at their site: darkcubes.net I hope they are easy to fix and make a hotfix for. These have happened on every server I've been on, so it isn't only on this one."

Thing is, we've encountered several issues with how Stores work, specifically in regards to inventories. One of those issues is that Stockpiles linked to Stores are incapable of accepting anything more than 10 ""blocks"" of any carry-able objects, and will not accept anything if there is even 1 ""block"" of any carry-able object, giving the error message ""not enough space in inventory"" (or something along those lines).

bug-reports,Version 6 Alpha CECA2382 Issue With stock piles | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2787/version-6-alpha-ceca2382-issue-with-stock-piles,1009,2,1,midn8t,"So I have two rooms, and stock pile is touching side of my house as shown in the picture below. in the picture I am standing on top of the room where my workbench and repair table is.. even though the stock pule is like 5 squares away - it can not get a link to my workbench, only way for me to get a link would be to build the stock pile directly on top of my house it seems. this was issue int the alpha also.  these giant stock piles really need a way bigger range so that we can actually  build houses with out having to have these things on top of them. as of currently we would need stock piles on all sides of a house,  a single room seems to take up the whole distance a stock pile is able to link to a table. it is not uncommon for people to build houses with many 10 by 10 or larger rooms attached and its silly that stock pile does not have a range above 120 or so squares. anyways I am done with this till next version again see how version 7 is when it comes out i guess, I am not sure what it is but me and my friends have not been playing game as much sense newer versions due to that game starting feel more like a chore then fun. specially with these stock piles...

Also if you run the server and have access to server files you can extend the link range of your storage. Another thing to remember is that alpha 6 is still in the bug testing phase and this could just be a bug that needs to be hit with the bug spray.

*The workbench is connected to many stockpiles and chests which all have space in them
*Neither I or any one else on the server can interact with any workbench now but the problem started with the carpenters bench
*Server wise - we are running it via LAN version 0.5.6.1
*We have tried rebooting the server, all players disconnected, all players quit the applications - problems has persisted. Might be worth noting the game broke about 20 minutes earlier when one of the players was trying to cancel around 50 work orders on the camp fire then the server become non-responsive and claimed all the clients had become disconnected. We restarted the server and it was fine to then cancel the orders HELP!!!"

After restarting my client they where still there. Other people on the server are seeing the same thing when they look at my field. Floating crops.

Since 5.6.1 the game has a more complex graphics options menu via ESC > Advanced. Try to disable ""Bloom"" and ""Fog"". It could also be helpful, to set the normal graphics option to: Shadow Quality = fastest / Foilage = Max."

When i start playing on these settings the game is better for a little while but it gradually goes back to lagging every 4-5 secs for 1-2 secs duration.  I have also noticed that the client eats all my ram and gets unplayable lag and then it will error, with an ""out of bounds"" error.
I posted a bug months ago (when i was using 5.4 version) about a memory leak in the client and it seems that it STILL has not been fixed. I have even read people with 16GB having the same issue. I believe the memory leak is the cause, and the lag is the symptom. It would be nice if i could hear back from one of the Devs on this issue"

However this did not prevent the rest of the smog in my pipe system from coming out at the factory rather then at the exhaust point. attached are photos of it, the factory is not running just other machines are. the leak main line on with factory disconnected Closed loop on main line, no leaks. what i think it is, is the down spout connects back to the factory but i think its a dummy connection so there is nothing preventing smog from exiting there instead of traveling through the pipe. nvm that didnt work either, lol its just leaky.. ?"

I set up a hosted server on 5.6.1 and did the same thing, but now the polution is leaking from my quary. So i build a 7x7x7 building to store my tailing, i put a stockpile inside it again and filled it with tailings. No doors, no windows, just a big cube around the stockpile. But this also is leaking polution everywhere. Is this a bug? Am i doing something wrong? It used to work for me?"

bug-reports,Frozen crafting timers | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2503/frozen-crafting-timers,1783,6,2,Master Who,"ok, I have found that if there is more than one crafting table in the room if you try to make the tables do projects, it will cause the frozen timers. I am guessing the projects are vying to be first and making the other tables not work until they are done. if the first table is missing something it will cause them all to freeze, even if you collect what is needed.

I built a Quarry machine, had it pump out some Mortared Stone, but the last 17 or so of it went into a Storage Chest (which ought not to be able to happen, since the Storage Chest can't store carried items and despite the fact that there was a Stockpile with available space in range of the Quarry). Now, I can't get the stone out of the chest, either by transferring it to my own Carrying slot, or moving it to my Cart or to the local Stockpile, and the Quarry keeps putting any new stone it makes there and not into the Stockpile. I've also tried moving the stone into one of my action bar slots and into my backpack but always get the ""Mortared Stone can only be carried"" error - the same error I get if I try and move it to a Stockpile, or to my Carrying slot. Am I toast here? I mean, I can't get rid of the chest (since it's not empty), nor can I use this Quarry any more (since it's misdirecting the stone). Anyone know of any way around this? I've also logged this into GitHub as per the ""How to report bugs"" post, but figured I'd post here in case some bright spark on these forums might know of a way around this, since this is now a major roadblock in my game (short of rebuilding a quarry in a new house with no nearby Storage Chests I guess)."

Another (very helpful) user has also pointed me towards some dev tools that may assist in killing the now unkillable storage chest in my old game, which I'll try loading at some point and seeing if that works (to at least recover that game). Still, it's obviously a bug and one that needs fixing (hopefully soon), since without admin rights, you'd be pretty much stuffed as it gates any further advancement down the technology tree if you could even (properly) make mortared stone."

There is also a bug in world generation dimensions and you can only use even numbers and current the devs recommend nothing over a 200X200 world (that is 4 times a default world) or to use 100X100 (default) or 140X140 (double size).  That does not mean a 200X200 world is 200 blocks by 200 blocks, as dimensions are chunks squared - I don't remember exactly and don't have the math handy, but a 4 Times world is very large. There is no way at this time that a 1000X1000 world could be supported or that it not working would be considered a bug.  The crash is that the game just cannot handle a world that large, and actually, at least at this time, is not meant to be that large."

Logging in while this is happening has been known to cause world errors. If this is the case I would suggest generating a new world and letting in finish before logging on.  If this is a world you have played on before I would try the following;  Backup Game.eco and put it in  a safe place.  Delete Game.eco from the storage folder and rename Archive.eco to Game.eco (case sensative) and start the server and see if you can log on then.  If that still causes a problem I would start tying backups until you find one that is unaffected and you can log in. You can load the Game.eco up to google drive or dropbox and the create a bug report in github and link the world save, Game.eco, to it so the devs can take a look.  They probably can't fix it for you but might be able to see what caused the problem to keep it from happening in the future."

Then walk up to the workbench while carrying the stone and right-click. It will automatically add it to the work order.

You will need to have a stockpile near your workbench and linked to it to hold the stone and then the workbench can find the stone and build the campfire.  Make sure that inventories are lined correctly and have the right authorizations  and that the table status is correct so that it can build a campfire. You can't ""put"" stone or logs etc in a workbench.  They have to 'pull' them from a linked stockpile"

If what you're saying is true then there is a catch 22. Meaning that you need a stockpile in order to use 'carry items' for a workbench, but in order to create a stockpile you have to use logs...which are carry items. So you would never be able to create a stockpile in order to create anything else. Here is me adding logs directly to a workbench to create a stockpile, without a stockpile or any other storage nearby.https://youtu.be/-gleAJz3TaA Here is me adding dirt directly to a workbench to create a dirt ramp, without a stockpile or any other storage nearby.https://youtu.be/2Lj2tCcX2hI I think what you mean is that it is possible to carry individual 'carry items' over one at a time like when picking up stone OR if you pick up multiples like logs, but to have a stockpile nearby that is linked to the workbench makes it much easier and quicker because the workbench will automatically pull the resources from the stockpile when a work order is created."

You can try using Archive.eco which is a game copy made at each startup to try and protect against corruptions.  To use it remove Game.eco from the storage folder and rename  Archive.eco to Game.eco (case sensitive). If that does not work you will need to go back to an older backup in the backup directory and rename it to Game.eco and place it in the storage folder to load.  By default the backup configuration file only saves a couple of backups and deletes all but about the last 3.  I recommend changing it to make a backup every hour and to save 23 of them so you have a days worth of backups.  On top of that you can run a scheduled task of some sort to back up the Backups folder once a day and save those 23 backups somewhere else.  This can give you several days of backups to go back to if you have an issue.

Extra details:
Removing dirt from the stockpile (or any resource) with an already growing tree on top of it doesn't remove the tree; so if one is growing it won't remove itself unless you remove it yourself. In my current stockpile the tree is placed on a rock tile. No new trees are growing on any of my stockpiles with various resources."

Yes they do act like that when not put on a road of flat surface or you dig under them - they certainly are not perfect yet .  They were much better in 5.5.4 and more work has been done on them I believe for 5.6 but that is a known issue. It helps to put the cart of a flat surface - preferably a piece of road and not wack it with the shovel, just dump the load into it.  The main problem you are having with it is you have the cart right where you are digging and digging under it - remember that it takes up 2 voxels, that includes the handles so digging under the handles will cause it to fall over into the hole you just dug.  Try putting it  couple of blocks away from where you are digging."

Try changing your password and make sure that it contains only numbers and letters - no symbols and starts with a  capital letter).  Make sure you log out of the launcher and enter your Name and new password again.  Try again and see if you still get an error If you still get the error do this. Make sure your game is not running.
Go into C:\Users(YourComputerName)\AppData\LocalLow\Strange Loop Games and delete the ECO folder.
Restart your game The ECO folder will be recreated when you start the game again and so will not hurt anything to delete it but there could be a corruption in there that is causing the token error. If that does not work contact supporrt@strangeloopgames.com so they can verify your account - make sure you tell them you have already done the above to try and fix it because they will tell you to do that first."

I wont do this again cause Rentechd will remove me from the forum if i do. (he pm'd me in a message.) These links i posted where a temp fix as the download links under account did not match versions.
Also these links i posted are official links from the eco game.

Hi black, i hope i can take a moment of your time, if you are the right person to send this message to.
If this hasnt been suggested yet by another person, could you suggest to the person'(s) in charge of the eco downloads / account verification's. To maybe add account verification to the official eco download links, in the form of only read rights. this would be very helpful.

SO making the download public is a problem.  Actually this whole thing came up because of a support request for someone who was playing the game without ever buying and when asked where he got the game without buying it he was able to point to this forum post.  And he was playing with help from others.  So just to be fair we are asking people not to post links to the downloads in the forums.  That has always been a rule so we are just continuing with it. And yes Zaskersky more security has been asked by NBT around the downloads and this  maybe coming.  I think it depends on whether they website purchase site will remain after the move to steam.  There have been some web site changes but not that yet as they need to balance dev work between web site and game.  Asking people that own the game not to publish links to the download should not be an inconvenience"

bug-reports,Pollution mechanics a little out of wack? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2046/pollution-mechanics-a-little-out-of-wack,2890,7,3,Imricdaelf,"Early over the weekend, the river next to our base had mysteriously turned pink. We had no airborne pollution at the time, so we dived into the river and found random tailings on the riverbed. Nobody had been in the river previously. I was the only one smelting ore (in the bloomery) in the area and have been placing all my tailings inside storage chests. We had also found some random tailings behind one of our buildings near where my chests were, but not close enough to mistakenly place the tailings on the ground instead of the chest.    So we regenerated the world and started over. Now as we are the admins on our server, we gave ourselves the skill books, building materials, etc etc to build a new base on the newly regenerated world and get us back to where we had been progression-wise.   I built a cave, fairly near a river but not next to it, and placed a cement kiln & blast furnace (with chimneys.)  I made some iron, steel, rebar, and concrete. Watched the new stats on pollution generation (great idea,) and was happy to know that I hadn't even generated enough pollution to reach 1PPM CO2 (lifetime pollution: 0.0340+0.034071 tonnes) Then I realize the green dirt blocks look slightly different to me, and my brain links it to pollution because that's what has happened before. So I went to the river and jumped in, maybe some more random tailings? No, nothing to suggest any ground pollution. I hadn't made any tailings yet at all either. River looks fine till I get to next to our base, and it's pink. The river is 55 to 80 blocks away from the chimneys producing the (air) pollution, depending on the angle (river bends). I know that pollution is a big thing, and pollution generators shouldn't be near farmland or water sources.  But I also know that (air) pollution isn't strong enough to turn a river foul when it's such a small amount and not directly next to it.   Some time later I was notified the river had turned back to blue, leading me to believe you've implemented a natural healing process to the world over time (awesome.) tl;dr
Sorry for the wall of text, but I try to be as clear as I can. [Air] pollution seems to be way too strong in regards to the land/water sensitivity to pollution."

Not sure but i dont think tailings should spawn by them self. Could it be some one griefed you maybe ? since you found random tailings in the water

Upon restart, everything was ok for a bit, but the river started to turn pink again. No tailings, no intentional pollution.

bug-reports,Campfire Light Glitch & Room Mechanics | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2424/campfire-light-glitch-room-mechanics,687,1,1,Therandus,"In the latest staging (21f43d75):
whenever you are walking towards anyones property that has a campfire (we think we've pinned it down to the campfire), you will see a bright white light that blinds you until you get closer. Every person on my server was experiencing this in this staging and the last staging. :) Also Im not sure if this is a bug, but chests are counted as Crafting Stations and the Room mechanics, when it should allow 3 crafting tables in a room that is big enough for all of them, wont let it happen if one chest is in there. In fact the room mechanics in these builds had been really hard to work with, having to break and rebuild the room until it allows it, when in the stable build it would be fine. And we need storage, so if this was an intended mechanic it should be changed, otherwise we would have to have one crafting table and 2 chests per room to actually get anything done. Which is a bit ridiculous, (unless we were to fiddle around with it and fix it every now and then to get more than that). confirmed in 94b0a99b, not sure about current build:
Not only that but we would also need a decent sized room much bigger than minimal requirements so that you don't accidentally suffocate (/Breathable thing) when moving chests and lose all your skill points instantly. :) There was one other thing, the people on my server hope its a bug, but Stockpile range is very, very small, right now its a big struggle to find storage for the Stockpiles that's within range of crafting tables.right now the max is 7 blocks (it was suggested increasing it to 15 at least). To make building a little simpler considering how much harder these new mechanics make it to store things."

bug-reports,Unable to join 5.6 servers | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2404/unable-to-join-5-6-servers,2079,7,2,rentechd,This may depends on which staging version the server is on.

Hello, Its not very hard to change to a difrent staging but it requires a bit of manual work.
the developers only have latest staging build on the website but do keep some of the older files on the download page but you have to manualy select the file in the internet adres bar, official eco link where you normaly download your eco but with out file name behind it, gives you a list of all files on there, use this link and then copy paste a eco version name behind it to download that version. [Edited on 03 July 2017 - To protect eco download adresses.]
To make this work login to your eco account on the website, go to the download section.
And right click on a download link copy the adress of the link, and paste it in your webbrowser.
then change the adress, in this fasion to see all the availible eco downloads.
example:................/eco-releases/EcoLinux_v0.5.3-alpha.zip
change it to:......./eco-releases/ (removing the file name will give you a text page with all versions.) for example, <Key>EcoLinux_v0.5.3-alpha.zip</Key> would become,
................./eco-releases/EcoLinux_v0.5.3-alpha.zip Hope you and other people strugeling with versions can now get the right versions.
Greetings Zaskersky"

There are currently 12 different staging versions for 5.6 and any 5.6 server out there could be any one of them depending on which one was installed and if they were updated or not.  Without knowing which staging version the server(s) have it would be hard to find the one you want to roll back to to find a compatible server.  The best bet is to try contacting the server admin either ins discord or in the #server_ads channel in the official Eco discord,  here in the servers topic of this forum or through ecoservers.io.  Otherwise you might have to install many different versions until you find the one you are looking for."

If someone put a store with a contract that didn't have a storage liked it creates a Invalid entry or ""something"" in the economy viewer (i've seen it in the server interface), after that if the player removes the store while this error is active it will cause a client crash/error when opening the Economy Viewer. If you have access to the server interface (not the pingperfect -aham- control panel) you will see that you can't open the economy tab from there as well. I recommend a rollback; because of this error i keep 48 backups each at 30 minutes, on all Eco servers that i have. Else, you can open the Game.eco with WinRar and see if you find anything of use there; maybe creating a new map the exact same size and adding folders and files from the old save to the new one will do anything.

bug-reports,Need a little more information on farming | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2407/need-a-little-more-information-on-farming,675,1,1,MagicBackPack,"specifically a few things on how nutrients are restored to depleted farm plots some things I've tried with varying success: my best successes have been with harvesting the entire field and leaving it fallow, but even with that I still have some plots, usually in a random grid (some 2x10 others 6x6 etc.) that are still depleted or very low on nutrients. I'd like to know more about exactly how the nutrient system works in the current build 0.5.5.4 as it is seemingly random.  is this a server side glitch causing the nutrients not to restore to some plots, is there some factor that I'm unaware of, or is it clientside.  right now farming can be inconsistent due to plots not restoring nutrients consistently leading to wasted seeds.  which is fine if it's part of the game design I just wanna know what to expect when farming so I can plan accordingly.  if it helps I've mainly been growing wheat to mass produce flour."
bug-reports,Stuck Underwater Effect | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2399/stuck-underwater-effect,1403,3,1,LunarBlacksmith,"Heya. So basically what happened was I made a little 1 'block'  low, 4x4 block wide, dent in the sand near water, then let the water in by getting rid of the wall of sand stopping it.
Accidentally, whilst moving one of the bits of sand, I picked up the dirt underneath me and went underwater. It has this underwater sound ""atmosphere"" I guess you could call it? Like if you punched someone underwater it sound more like hitting cardboard than a fruit. I jumped and placed the dirt back into the whole I was just in, and got out of the water completely. I then proceeded to cut some trees down and noticed that everything still sounded like I was underwater. I tried everything to get rid of it that I knew of - logging in and out, exiting both my server and game completely and back in, using the ""/unstuck"" command - nothing would work. I wasn't sure where else to put this so here we are."

Have you tried updating your graphics drivers?
Does this happen on new servers you've never played on?
What's your rig's specs? windows version included 64bit or 32bit?
How are you logging off for the night from the server? Alt-f4 or Esc-quit?
Have you enabled clambering? I think what your problem is, either your internet was slow at the moment you log off from each of these servers, or a graphical glitch is causing your player to fall through the world or become stuck just after you log off.
Here are a few theoretical fixes for you that are easy to perform.
-Delete your game files, re-download
-Clear your cache of temporary files or do a disc cleanup
-Restart your modem and/or wireless router"

After numerous attempts to remake the roof, chimney, and location of the kiln, I finally, randomly, renamed the kiln to SlowMoney's HempCrete Kiln, and poof the @#$@ thing works. Additionally, I noticed that when I had the Blast Furnace setup in the same room, the cement kiln would sometimes show the status of the Blast Furnace instead. I assume these things are somehow related, since changing a name, a variable name from your side of things, seems to cure the issue."

If this happening I suggest that you take a copy of the world it tried to create (the Game.eco) and the crash log it produced and zip them up and post them in a drop box or google drive and link them for the devs to look at.  They need to look at these to see what the issues are and in the meantime while waiting to hear from them go back to a 100X100 world which we know is working.  I guess you have not looked in your dump folder but I checked for you and all you are doing is producing 100's of crash dumps over and over again - your not generating a world - just taxing the server.  When you have issues like this you need to check the dump folder for error logs and crash dumps.  Simply redoing the same thing over and over and crashing the server over and over will not fix the issue"

That is apparently not working for most people.  They are deleting the files in storage and still are crashing trying to create anything over 100X100 Your solution is just the correct steps to generating a ne world which you have to do if you change size - you can't change the size of a world that was already generated.  The problem appears to be that even if a new world is generated the crashing  happens with anything but 100X100

I was able to build a 140X140 and  a 174X174 and 200X200 world without issues (although that 200X200 world required a bit of extra RAM).  Then I went back and tried 141X141 and 173X173 (the numbers given us by SLG for 2X and #x world creation) and they both failed again.  The ""Freezing"" part did take a extra long time compared to the length of time it takes in the default world.  Apparently you can use the world while the ""Freezing' is taking place but just so you know that the world won't be complete until that phase is over.  I still think that there should be a network block to logins until the world completes all the generation steps."

It would also be nice if the TCAdmin control panels used by Killerservers and Pingperfect actually showed the progression like the you can see when starting one locally.  I know it still wouldn't stop people from entering the server but at least it would allow for the server admin to let people know when it is done rather than guessing by waiting for the CPU usage to drop.

I think you are getting things confused here. When people say ""you should restart your game"" then me that you should log out of the server and out of the game completely and then start the game back up and log into the server. When people say ""You should reboot""  they are talking about turning the server hardware off  or stopping the server and turning it and back on and re-loading the game completely, no matter where the server is locate d-hosted or in your own home. If people tale about resetting your world or re-generating it that means you need to stop your server/game , to delete the Game.eco in your Storage folder and start the game back up so that it creates a new world. In the case of lost carts etc you don't need to tell people to regenerate a world and lose all their structures etc.  Usually the can just look on the deed and see what coordinates the cart is at and go there.  If there is a negative in the coord that tends to mean the cart is probably gone and won't come back but its still worth taking a look for it. Sometimes logging our and back in the game - restarting your game - will cause a cart to come back.  That does not often work. Getting the server rebooted often returns the cart to the surface.  You might still have to go look for it but it should bring it to where it does not have any negatives in the coords The Server admin can always spawn in a new cart if you have lost one or you can just build a new one"

Restarting the OS does seem to help for whatever reasons. This again is not guaranteed.

Yes the cart disappearing is an issue and its definitely in the bug list and the devs are aware of it!  Its frustrating but some things are in alphas.  To many a cart disappearing now and then is not a big deal as they used carts back when they were more Frisbees they tools to move resources around and so occasionally having to hunt one down or replace it does not get the chatter misbehaving carts used to get - which may make you think people are not concerned about it.  They are concerned but about 90% of the people posting here see the carts as 100% improved over what they were (aka they work now) so aren't coming on to complain.  That is not to say they should not complain but they aren't but that does not mean the devs are not taking it seriously.

I checked the location on the cart deed and it said it was right where I was standing, however it wasn't visible. I tried swinging my hammer around the area where it said the cart was but was never able to recover it either time. I'm hoping this issue is still being looked at?  It's a very frustrating one.  It looks like a similar issue has been closed on github for some reason?  It's certainly still occurring."

If the deed shows - in the location the cart is usually gone even if you go to the coordinates.  I know this is frustrating but this is the problem with playing an alpha.  At least you can use carts now where ins 5.4 there were basically unusable so they have improved - and that is all you can ask for - improvement.
bug-reports,Deed and claimed land glitch. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2293/deed-and-claimed-land-glitch,1314,5,1,Hefty,"I've had this issue on 3 servers now. One was unmodded, I'm not sure about the second, and then my own server running 5.5.4 and the default ClaysTK mod pack. Last night was my own server, I was the only one online and talking to Pam on the ECO discord as it happened. I put down all 10 starter construction posts on the top of this plateau and started building a house in the middle of them. About a hour and a half later I crafted 5 more to finish claiming the rest of the plateau and the posts wouldn't highlight any of the plots. My claimed one's weren't yellow or red and unclaimed ones weren't green. I could place the posts but they would say ""Nobody's Construction Post"" and I could put as many down as I wanted all right next to each other. The deed never left my bag. Pam suggested that I try the admin command /claim. When I did it said you already own this. So I tried /unclaim and it said this is already public. Clicking the same commands on the deed itself gave the same results. I went around and /unclaim'd each little plot that was highlighted on the map and then tried to claim the deed again, and it said the same thing. Pam suggested that I restart the server and erase my appdata. After doing that the deed said it didn't claim any land and all of the coordinates were gone from the tool tip. Now all of the craft tables say Nobody's and I can't reclaim the land at all. I'm inclined to think my character data is the source of this issue, since it has happened on multiple servers now."

This isn't an issue I've ever heard of before. The world save should be in the game.eco file in your ""%server_files%\storage"", which shouldn't be affected by a restart at all. If you want a refund you can e-mail SLG support at support@strangeloopgames.com and explain your issue."
bug-reports,LAN server resetting | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2270/lan-server-resetting,1709,3,3,rentechd,"If the server is installed correctly there should be backups stored in the  /Storage/backups/ directory.  In there should be the backups you have scheduled in backup.eco - by default a backup every 30 minutes and by default it keeps the last 5. the problem is that if its restarting the game fresh on a scheduled reboot then it would be backing up that new world and only saving 5 of the latest backups so that your backups with the world you worked in will be gone.  What i would do first is edit your backup.eco file (configuration file) and change it to look like this, this will save the game every 30 minutes and save 24 hours for you.: {
""$id"": ""1"",
""BackupFrequencyInMinutes"": 30,
""NumBackupsToKeep"": 47
} OR  - this will save the game every hour and save 24 hours worth for you: {
""$id"": ""1"",
""BackupFrequencyInMinutes"": 60,
""NumBackupsToKeep"": 23
} Now once you have that set up and restarted your world you game will start making a backup every 30-60 minutes (depending on what you set) and it will save a days worth so you should be able to go back right before the restart and find the backup to us.  It will be named with the date and time of the save.  Just rename it to ""Game.eco""  (case sensative) and it should load it back up and no problem. I would also consider setting up an external backup script that runs on your server once a day and  zips up a copy of /Storage/Game.eco, /Storage/Archive.eco and /Storage/Backup/. Then you would have all the backups from a whole day and the most current Game and Archive.eco at the time you ran the script - probably bets to run that right before you do your restart. The big question here is why is a restart deleting your Game.eco file which is why the game is starting over each time.  The only way a world gets 'reset' and you start over is if the game does not find a Game.eco file to load.   Simply stopping the game and starting it back up should not be removing any files so you need to look at what that process is that you are running that does the restart - it almost sounds like you have a reinstall script running that is deleting everything and installing all new files.  If that is the case BE CAREFUL because this would mean it would also delete all your backups (no matter how many you have made during the day) when you do this restart.  I would manually save (copy and paste them) somewhere else on your computer until you know that your processes are not completely deleting and reinstalling your game each time you do a restart. This is not a bug but some problem with how teh game has been installed/set up and how its set up to be managed.  The backup process has been running just fine with the servers and there is actually no mechanisim that would delete these storage files.   In addition the Game.eco is stored to a file named Archive.eco each time it starts up.  I suspect that you don't get to see that file after a restart because there is something wrong with how you have this set up which is causing your computer to reinstall the game and not 'restart' the server.  there is some old posts/info out on the web instructing people to reinstall the server over and over instead of just resetting the Game.eco and or just starting and stopping the server.  I am not sure if that info was put out there to troll people  or if, at one time very early on, the only thing you could do to control the game was reinstall but because of that we have had to remove options for users to even access the 'reinstall' option"
bug-reports,Memory leaks? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2262/memory-leaks,1762,2,1,thepenguinmaster,"I have been monitoring the server software as it runs and it is showing signs of memory issues. In general it appears there are memory leaks. larger maps run for more time will show theses problems. There is also question about scaling in code. Over time, if run on a larger map for long enough, the server will consume all of the RAM. I assume this may have already been reported, but in a quick browsing of the forum, I have not seen it reported. Also there is something odd about map loading, almost as if for each resource (map, items, etc) a full copy of the map is loaded. Even after compression is accounted for, the server takes up about three times the map file size for each entity set loaded. Also breaking the world file into chunks in the zip stream also helps. Say have world file, then in there have chunk files. When a single chunk is generated, flush it to file. Also instead of representing blocks as .net objects, it is a bit more efficient and memory save to have memory chunks where blocks are represented by bytes. You can then have block type byte, and for other items and properties, do something like how vertex data works in a GPU, have a 2nd list that contains additional data, and points to the specific record in the main chunk. This prevents additional objects from being created where they are not needed. I am not sure where the memory leaks are coming from, but I assume it is related to when players login to the server, and additional objects are loaded into memory. Overall the game is great, but there are some challenges working with .net and not having full control over chunk buffers, but i think with a little more attention on memory usage and chunk loading, it can be worked out."
bug-reports,Memory leaks? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2262/memory-leaks,1762,2,2,rentechd,There are known memory leaks.  This is mainly due to Unity's poor garbage clean up handling and it makes it hard to fix/fix these issues. The big memory leak is actually with the client and you will often need to recycle/restart the game every couple of hours.  The garbage handlers are bad with teh client side leak and not all memory is being returned when the game is recycled/restarted/shutdown and this usually requires that the client hardware itself requires a shutdown/reboot. The server does have a memory leak but not to the extent secend on the server.  Most servers do well with a daily recycle (server stopped and started again) and the memory freed that way.  In the majority of the cases simply shutting the game off and starting it back up again was all that was needed to clear the memory - hardware did not need to be rebooted.  At the most we have required to restart the hardware once in a week although  certainly that can be monitored and would depend on the hardware and RAM available on a server.

I have a video that shows it took 43 seconds for my second research table to be viewable and usable in game.  While slow loading times wouldn't be much of an issue for me normally in this scenario it does become problematic and allows for griefers to take advantage of it. If it is taking 20-30 seconds for doors to load a griefer can easily access my locked house while I am offline and help themselves to any items in my public storage.  Here is where the scenario part roles into this.... I have two other people on my lease, they use my tables to create items as they have higher efficiencies than me, but I have higher efficiencies at research, so they place the items into public storage so that I can do the research next time i log on. Due to the loading issues griefers have been able to take advantage of this, get items and then use the unstuck command, or just log off and back on to exit the building. The server is a dedicated server running 16 Gigs of ram with an up to date processor, and the client is being run on and Asus gaming laptop g752vt with 32 gigs of ram and windows 10.

Today for some unknown reason, it appeared every single animal just suddenly fell and died, complete wipeout. We dont have high pollution, we have been replanting wild seeds to make sure levels rise up etc, but then boom, RIP all dead. So on checking the Eco graphs, they confirmed what a player on our server said, a mass global death. But the plot thickens, on checking the finer detail, there would be 1 turkey, and 1 Hare left. Did they go on as mass killing, a somewhat Avatar relationship with a bit Jackal and Hyde thrown in? No idea, anyway there is a odd bug here and we dont know why, and not sure how to fix it yet, going to maybe try a backup incase something just went odd and wiped them all, but here is the graphs http://95.154.229.150:3041/"

As in real life if an animal is being chased or spooked in the wild they will tend to run up hill unless injured. Injured animals will tend to run downhill. I was simply asking a question about the AI, as it would appear that it is designed to make animals run up hill as a natural form of travel. However, they will continue to roam around and eventually come back down form the peaks during the evening and night hours, animals typically wont bed down in high elevation due to the cold. They will usually find their way to a deep grassy valley passing near a food source and water. Unless its a windy night they may stick to the dense forest with a grassy floor to keep out of the wind. Calm nights with bright moon they will usually not bed down but stay up and sleep during the day. So see, my question was simply a question of AI, not a 'passive aggressive' statement about a bug !!!"

bug-reports,Beets temp variance math is wrong | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2142/beets-temp-variance-math-is-wrong,1712,6,1,Prayr,"trying to find a good spot to grow beets, 12.5 desired temp and 45% moisture. Found a spot with 12.0 temp and 41% moisture, only yields 1 beet, and says temp match is at 73%, Isn't 12.0 96% of 12.5 ?? So what is it I am missing that makes the math off on this ?"
bug-reports,Beets temp variance math is wrong | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2142/beets-temp-variance-math-is-wrong,1712,6,2,Zaskersky,"Yea the math works a bit difrent i dont know the exact numbers but im gonna give a fictional example of how the math works. Lets say for example these Beet's grow at 12,5 degrease desired, and the beet are 100% then.
and the beets have 0% desired temprature when there's more then 2 degrease difrence so it would be 0% at,
more then 14,5 and less then 10,5. I think it works like this, keep in mind i took the 10.5 abd 14,5 as fictional numbers for the actual numbers we need to test ingame.
then this would be the result if there is no curve in the math,
10.5 - 0%
11.0 - 25%
11.5 - 50%
12.0 - 75%
12.3 - 90%
12.5 - 100%
12.7 - 90%
13.0 - 75%
13.5 - 50%
14.0 - 25%
14.5 - 0% Hope this makes sense,"
bug-reports,Beets temp variance math is wrong | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2142/beets-temp-variance-math-is-wrong,1712,6,3,Zaskersky,"Ok i became intrested and took some actual measurment from in game this time to get some numbers straight. here is a litle somthing i gathered. Beets - 12 Desired
14.8 = -41%
14.1 = -4%
13.9 = 3%
13.4 = 28%
13.3 = 35%
13.2 = 38%
12.6 = 68%
12.2 = 92%
12.0 = 100%
11.4 = 68% So i took a lot of difrent temprature samples by planting beets,
and what we can see its not a steady increase/decrease,
so get a 100% clear picture we would need a measure points at every 0.1 temprature difrence. but let me create a simple line graph to give you a id with the data i colected a perfect graph
would have a smooth curving line. "

The issue is, i logged in today and my blast furnace would not work, it said i needed more room volume (which i currently had 136 volume according to your new updated interface you added in the bottom left) and also said i needed more bricks,  i went to check out other tables and they state my rooms need to be closed and would not work either, but moments before they were working and producing items. my rooms are totally enclosed, with doors and not working on adding windows to see if that helps. but right now i can't really play because i cant craft anything. Things i've tried Destroy and replace table
Remove other tables and swap to different rooms
Build new room and place newly made table. I'm waiting for desmond to get on to try a server restart. Edit- Blast furnace now works somehow, but my anvil that's in the same room says that it needs to be in a room to work. Other tables are still broken aswell"

I guess its something I have just not seen when starting up after installing new files.  I  am sure someone will explain it.  For the heck of it I went and installed 5.5.1 over a 5.5 server, then installed 5.5.2 and then 5.5.3  (the world in that 5.5 server had been converted from a 5.4 world) but I did not see anything in the console about converting.  I did get a dump file with exceptions like the ones you posted but the server did not crash so no crash log. Have you tried renaming Archive.eco to Game.eco (saving the existing game.eco elsewhere in case the devs want to see it or you want to try using it again) and see if it will load the world then?  Sometimes that will work if there is a corruption going on when the server starts up and writes the new world file.  Otherwise you might want to see if the dev's want you to post that Game.eco that is failing so they can look at it and try and reproduce your problem."

Are the two of you standing on opposite sides of the border between a 0 coordinate and whatever the max coordinate in your world is when it happens? When you cross the border and your coordinates loop around to 0 (or the other way around) you technically get teleported, so you don't always see everything on the other side.

Its most obvious around tables and workbenches and machines and other objects like that.  It happens other places too - just not as noticeable.  Like I can walk up to a tree I just felled  so that I can position myself to chop off a log and then I slide over.  The slide is, in my case, usually to the left.

So if you are playing on someone else's server you would need to ask them if they would install the mod for you or look for a server that already has the mod installed.

bug-reports,Storage problem | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2073/storage-problem,3019,16,11,rentechd,I don't think that A chest should hold more then 150 items.  Think of how big a chest would have to be to hold 150 logs of wood!  That is why my firewood is stored outside in a log pile and not in my garage in a bunch of chests.  Yes I can get well over 150 small household items in a large chest but not things like large resources.  I think just increasing the stack size in a chest - is very artificial and too neat.  You are doing it for  the sake of the player that wants easy gameplay solution.  Think of how you would solve pollution immediately in the world if a chest could hold 100 things no matter how large or how much they weighted?   You could just stuff 100 wreaked and rusted cars in a chest and not need a junkyard.  I could stack a cord of wood in a couple of chests inside instead of maintaining a wood pile outside.  But that is far from how it really works so it makes sense that weight is taken into consideration and that chests have a weight (or think of it as volume) limit as well as a count at this time - as chests are the storage solution but stockpiles make a more realistic  storage solution.
bug-reports,Storage problem | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2073/storage-problem,3019,16,12,Master Who,"That is kinda why  I kept my molded chest with weight. If a player builds a 64 slots chest,  they can not fill it full of trailing,  but if they had a bunch of seeds, sure. I double the weight of Big, and double again for Bigger. (40,80,120) Edit: but Clay's tool kit used to work with my mod to erase the weight limit, but as of 5.5, it is broke."
bug-reports,Storage problem | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2073/storage-problem,3019,16,13,NoBlackThunder,I think the idea is to use stockpiles instead of chest as a sort of upgrade to chest later. and if i am not wrong the idea is also that you can move stockpiles
bug-reports,Storage problem | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2073/storage-problem,3019,16,14,rentechd,"Yes, and that makes sense.  And I don't have a problem with the way chests work right now - as chests are the current solution and making what they hold be constrained by number and weight makes sense rather then just it being by number.  My main point was that what Auzze said about just increasing stack size and not going to a stock pile system is maybe ""the easy way"" but not a very good or elegant solution given what the game is all about IMO.  Solving messy by arbitrarily allowing everything to be stuffed in a box is not how the world works.  How nice it would be to solve a problem of too many tailings by just waving a magic wand and allowing a box to hold more rather then have them in a  messy stockpile is part of managing things"
bug-reports,Storage problem | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2073/storage-problem,3019,16,15,Master Who,I concur.  One of the reasons I made my mod (besides to see if I could) was to give more use to lumber and storage ranks (back in 5.4) With Bigger I added both copper and iron to give players more pollution from smelting/blastering .
bug-reports,Storage problem | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2073/storage-problem,3019,16,16,Auzze,"Food for thought. Why not be able to craft larger storage boxes
Chest holds 14 stacks
Trunk holds 22 stacks
Crates holds 30 stacks
This could be linked to storage skill tree. You will still need something to hold the tailings in, a ""stockpile"" would be open to the air and pollute"

When we saw the meteor in the sky I noticed and reset the meteor timer to 6 months. As it was already disabled but was still coming.
It seems the map goes out when we hit the 7 day mark witch is when the meteor would impact. This also unclaimed everyone's land on the server, because the map thinks its dead. So I think the meteor may be bugged. Because it's was always disabled should not have even came with the counter on 7 days."

I am wondering if you added files that really belong in the exe and that is confusing the issue?  As far as I know if you change the disaster setting you have to generate the world for it to take effect so either there was a world generated after you added these files with the 7 day setting or the game.eco has some corruption or other problem causing these issues or there is some error in the config file.  You can save your current Game.eco off somewhere and then make sure that your configuration files are configured correctly then generate a new world.  If the new world  generates without the issues you are seeing -  then its most likely something broken in your game.eco saved world.  If the same issues do happen then there there is something broken in your install and/or game files and you might need a freash clean reinstall of the game where everything installs correctly and you don't have to import files

I've now seen two instances of a cart ending up outside the world border. The first was posted in Discord by DesmondClarke, and the cart ended up at -20, 1077 in a 100x100 world. In my instance the cart ended up around 1520, 584 in a 150x150 world. In DesmondClarke's case the owner of the cart was the last one to use it, and it was currently not being dragged when it suddenly had disappeared. In my case a friend of mine had been using it, and it disappeared off the map at some point. He had been gathering wood from the 1500-side of the border and had brought it back. The place he left it is in the same z-coordinate (assuming 3rd coordinate is z) as what the deed says, and the x-coordinate is also correct, just it didn't teleport when crossing the border, so it added 20 to 1500 instead of adding 20 from zero. I've not been able to reproduce this bug yet. Or at least that's the best explanation I've been able to come up with so far. EDIT: Apparently my world just decided that the cart was going to reappear. Unsure what caused this to happen, perhaps I updated the blocks where the cart was standing or something. EDIT 2: Perhaps related to the unloading of what's on the other side of the border, as the teleport happens, so as you walk through the border the cart might unload before it crosses, but not all of it so the coordinates are still updated or something?"

I started playing two days ago and had to change servers two times now.
I've built a house, decided to continue tomorrow and poof the same server is now incompatible.
Feels awful to start building again and again just because that. I don't think there's new version of the game every day, so what is happening??? My client version is: 0.05 alpha release -of28891d"
bug-reports,Servers become incompatible all the time | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2018/servers-become-incompatible-all-the-time,1595,6,2,Khailik,New patches do indeed get released often. Go to the accounts section on the eco website and it should list the latest version. Current version at the time of this posting is 5.5.1
bug-reports,Servers become incompatible all the time | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2018/servers-become-incompatible-all-the-time,1595,6,3,MGrand3,"Alpha 5.5.1 was released yesterday, could be that the server updated to that. You can find the update on your account page where you initially downloaded the game. Definitely worth updating, the patch fixes some framerate issues among other things."

bug-reports,Mining Glitch Found | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2009/mining-glitch-found,981,5,1,Alderone,"Well picking a stone if you switch to your shovel, it auto-picks the stone right into your shovel. This needs to be fixed because you only use the amount of calories you would with one swing."
bug-reports,Mining Glitch Found | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2009/mining-glitch-found,981,5,2,MGrand3,"Will add that this can happen with shovels too, where you dig up two blocks before the server realizes you dug the first one and you end up with two blocks in your shovel."
bug-reports,Mining Glitch Found | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2009/mining-glitch-found,981,5,3,Alderone,No not that you pick up 2 blocks you still only get one block. But you only have to do one swing and switch from pick axe to shovel as you swing. So basically you only need to make one swing at a chuck of stone or ore you can break up the stone or ore as you pick it up. So you start your swing with your pick axe and end up automatically end up with the piece on your shovel. So you basically skip the shoveling step. I can post a video on this matter when I get home from work if you would like?

All i remember before this happened, i was helping a guy move he's house, and he had a dozen of frozen rabbits that i picked off because, hey, free meat, i then looked down to shoot three rabbits stuck in on each other, and everything went black (All but the HUD).

Sadly you have to contact the server admin to get him to use a workaround to fix your player position that is causing the issue

bug-reports,Stuck in loading screen | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1967/stuck-in-loading-screen,1100,4,4,NoBlackThunder,Best thing is to ask if they have a discord or any other form of group outsite of the game. Though that issue should not be an issue hopefully in the future with 5.5 now being released

I remember in 3.5 and in 4 asking about stairs issues, and was told that they never been implemented way there suppose to be in 5.5 there still not implemented 100% way they are meant to be, but hopefully they will be soon. !"

which ends up punishing every one on the server. I have had to roll back server three times due to this already to help out and keep things some what fair to players and last time i had roll it 6 hours and half due to it going over night before the players effected got back on to play again and noticed issue. so every one on server got punished and lost 6 hours or so due to one person being an aholl I decide to put this into bugs section because of the amount of trouble this has been sense start of multiplayer and land deeds."

You might wanna remove dust from your computer to resolve the issue. Compressed air is the easiest way to do that but be careful that you hold air bottles always strait and only give it short burst so and make sure the compressed air bottle is not getting to cold because it might spit out very cold air that will make ice from on your computer =)

It could be just a matter of poor optimization is causing the components to draw more power which is causing the shutdown. Memory leak would result in a BSOD at most, not a complete shutdown. You can run Furmark's CPU stress test or video test to verify they're both okay, this will show power draw as well.http://www.ozone3d.net/benchmarks/fur/ Hope you get it figured out, remember PC issues are just excuses to buy new parts or in my case, job security :) Beercules!"

I literally just reached 50 skill points about 10 minutes ago only to find that when I spent my 50 points on Metalworking it didn't register.
So now only did I lose my 50 points but I also didn't get Metalworking level 1. Essentially today was a massive waste of time.
Does anyone know why this happened and/or ways to prevent it happening again?"
bug-reports,Off Switch? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/968/off-switch,1673,5,1,Furbal,"I'm not sure this is a bug per se, but I know that if something I have takes fuel to run, i.e. wall or ceiling candles, forges, etc.; I know I am able to control them by turning them OFF so they stop consuming fuel. Since you can't take fuel out and move it to the storage page and vice versa (and why not?), why isn't there an on/off switch for EVERYTHING that takes fuel of some kind? You can blow a candle out. You can quench a fire and in the case of coal, you can simply not add more... an off switch should be mandatory."

Forges and similar have a bit of a bug, as far as I'm aware per a github tracker, that indicates that they consume fuel when not in use.  Generally, they should only consume fuel when there's an active work, then it automatically stops using fuel.   Though a server reboot, (or something) will make it use fuel despite no work. Can't say anything about things like a candle or brazier."

The Butchering Efficiency is stating that it decreases the cost of making Raw Meat, etc. So I would assume that to say, when I order 100 orders of Butcher Elk, I would only need, say, 89 Elk and get 1000 Raw Meat. The Elk cost is correct, BUT I only get 881 Raw Meat. This means I'm getting less than 10 meat / Elk :/. Coincidentally, I would change how the Efficiency skills work for ""1 item turns into 10+ items"" - instead of lowering the input cost, it would be great if it increased the output. So say, 10% butchering efficiency would mean getting 11 meat from 1 elk, rather than taking 9 elk to make 100 meat."

bug-reports,Crafting structure canceling progress error | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1768/crafting-structure-canceling-progress-error,1002,3,1,Imperiul,"Server, Client or Website?Client OS/Web Browser?Windows 10 64bit - Chrome Detailed Description of Issue:
I found an error that is happening on every machine (bloomery, worktable etc...)
When I place the order on the machine (lets say Iron ingots x20 on Bloomery) and I want to cancel it, the ore's are going back in the inventory.
BUT!
If I cancel the order while my inventory is full, the ore gets back on my shovel.
BUT!
If I cancel the order while my inventory and shovel is full, the returning ore will dissapear. That's how I lost 60 ore's yesterday. Reproducible? How difficult is it to reproduce?
Easy. Steps to reproduce bug/issue:
Place a work order that is about 10 item count or more and have the public/private Storage full + your shovel is full.
Item required for the item creation can be carried only in the carrying slot. Client Version? [Alpha .01 for example]
Alpha EcoPC_v0.5.4"

Now with lv 3 efficiency, I can get 14 elks worth of meat just with 10 elks, but the problem is that the ""efficiency"" also cuts the meat it produces! Each elk gives me 7 meat! So in the end with 10 elks I get 98 meat, less than somebody without any points invested in efficiency!
Same goes for when I try to make wild mix ( and much much more including bison meat which is also really important ) I got 61% efficiency but when I try to make 100 of them from 200 camas cost it only goes down to 155, and the fiddleheads are even weirder I have to pay 193 instead of 200 with 61% efficiency!

(It also produces skins but ignoring that) with no training in large butchery efficiency you can butcher 1 elk for 10 meat (100 job runs would consume 100 elk for 1000 meat)
with 3 training in large butchery efficiency you can butcher 1 elk for 7 meat (143 job runs would consume 100 elk for 996 meat)
with 4 training in large butchery efficiency you can butcher 1 elk for 7 meat (160 job runs would consume 100 elk for 1000 meat) So I'm not a hundred percent sure what's going on here.  When I start adding more elk to the order the amount of meat I would get comes out odd like 1 elk for 7 meat, 2 for 13 (while at lvl 4).  If i put it in as two orders of 1 elk I'd have 14 instead of 13."

Efficiency for met (is supposed to) give you some ""extra elks"" instead of giving you extra meat, while efficiencies that work like the wild mix reduce the base cost, of the ingredients. When I have 10 elks, no matter the efficiency level I would like to be able to press 10 and chop 10 elks not having to press 19 to get 19/10 for example, that just looks weird."

One thing i noticed is when that is exit spot form underground to above ground, and the sound is switching form silent to birds and stuff and it seems to glitch out at that time period each and every time but only with the cart. removing the ramp makes it drop back to the ground but it rolls forward and then i put a new ramp and new dirt under the ramp and i end up with same problem all over again."

The carts seem to block in certain spot - certain in this case means the same x/y/z position. (You have to remember the spot, coz this is propably going to last till next update)
Temporary solution is to get wider road or remove ramps. I have quarry above my settlement so I can take cart with me (in backpack) and place it above so i can ride all he way down there. In my case - when I went further away/reconnected carts went invisible.
I hammered down the ramps and they magically reappeared usable again."

no blocks under or around them..  you will have trouble free issues for most part till cart clips into ground and flys off some where  like on top of your building or a tree"

I remove the dirt under the ramp leaving just one row with dirt on the top so you can place the ramp so it gets level to where you wanna go. To expliain better: normaly you have 1 2x4 to place a ramp. meaning you have 4 long and 2 wide. Do it as 1 long and 2 wide. The rest one layer down. Then place from a angle so it places as useal. might also work to just dig way all dirt under after you placed the ramp. it might work haven't tryied.
EDIT: It worked to fix the bugged ramp to remove ALL dirt under the bugged ramp. i had about 5 bugged ramps before and none now."

bug-reports,Waterfall sound issue. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1704/waterfall-sound-issue,2319,9,8,Crua9,"@AnimeDan
I think that is on all servers. As long as you're not in a cave or house. You can hear some water. This is obviously a bug. They basically need to make it if bla amount of blocks have water, then make the sound so far away. If the water is moving, then make the waterfall sound so far away. I don't know what the coding is like on the backend, so I can't tell you how easy it would be to fix this. But I would think if it was easy, it would've already been done"
bug-reports,Waterfall sound issue. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1704/waterfall-sound-issue,2319,9,9,Desmond Clarke,"I figured out why we were all hearing the river flow sound on my server. I mistakenly set the SyncToClient option to ""False"" on the WaterSpread world layer. SyncToClient MUST be set to ""True"", otherwise the client will play the sound forever and always. I'm guessing the client uses this layer to decide where a river is and where in the world to play the sound. I have confirmed this by setting it to true, hearing no more river, setting it to false, and hearing it again. So based on this what I think happened to @Benami is: if you remove the water blocks of a river, you'll still hear the sound of the water because it may not be based on the blocks but instead on where the WaterSpread layer shows a river should be.

bug-reports,Controls input lag. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1611/controls-input-lag,2258,6,1,Augustaeum,"I am not quite sure if it is a feature or an issue, but there is a half-second delay between me pressing W/A/S/D or moving the mouse, and the game responding with movement. Does not sound like a lot, but it is noticeable and gives me a slight headache. I have an Intel i5 4670k, AMD Radeon R9-290, and 16bg of RAM; and according to Windows 10 task-manager Eco uses about 5gb of ram (granted I do have view distance maxed at 150) bringing me to a total of 11gb of ram in use during game-play, and no more than 25-30% of my cpu power, which I do believe rules any kind of throttling on my end. There is no reproducible action as, for me at least, it happens as soon as and as long as I am in game, nor does the game crash, the animations of the grass are not slow or laggy at all so I'm just chalking up to input lag, really bad input lag. EDIT: Added i5 to cpu mention."
bug-reports,Controls input lag. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1611/controls-input-lag,2258,6,2,NoBlackThunder,Mhh odd . 500 ms delay sounds like allot to be honest. To you experience thinks that you could define as allot of lag? and the control lag gets worse as more you play? Do you get it or is it as bad when you turn down your graphics?
bug-reports,Controls input lag. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1611/controls-input-lag,2258,6,3,Augustaeum,"So the server browser says that the connection to my server is only 19ms. I believe that as I am hosting the server myself, and it's on the other side of the wall from my computer and connected via Ethernet so I would imagine it's not a latency issue. The input lag stays the same no matter how long I play, and I just tested it again while messing around with the video settings: With Graphics quality, Foliage quality, Rendering scale, and, View distance down all the way I still get it, with all four of those sliders as far left as I can bring them, I still get the input lag. So while typing the above paragraph I was messing around with the game settings, and for the heck of it I lowered my Minimap Details slider all the way and that fixed the issue, the Maxed mini-map details breaks the game, or at least my comp can't handle it. EDIT: Now I get to restart my server because I'm too hungry to gather the food I need eat to satiate my hunger so I can gather the food I need to eat; what a catch 22.

Many anti viruses look if an app has a signature file and if they contain any advanced features that are actually pretty common. Its nothing new that anti viruses give false positives.

Not sure about carts though XD Placement of things like stairs and roofs is likely to get a big revamp later down the line. Back in Alpha 4, Wheat was relatively rare, which caused a big problem. I think they've overcompensated for that problem. The rarity of beans is due to world generation not creating very many forest blocks. This is a known issue."

Its really hard to say right now ,we are using the unity engine that comes with a sound engine. I know that somethimes it can be really stupid thinks causing audio bugs that is why i asked if your sound in general worked because i had sound issues because of windows before that tricked me ;) . Now even if you work at it i still need to ask you my stupid question ( sorry but i need to make sure you did not overlooked something simple hehe ) 1.Have you checked your default devices ? Your current output is set as default device?
2. Have you checked in game that the audio is not muted there ( i have had it muted for an odd reason once there )
3. Can you open the  playback device view and start eco and see if any sound meter for any output there is moving when playing ( make sure that you maxed your audio ingame)"

We officially don't really support linux and mac servers right now. but dont worry there are 2 thinks you can try.
bug-reports,Alpha 5.4 Linux - Broken/Missing Directory Trees | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1522/alpha-5-4-linux-broken-missing-directory-trees,1724,8,3,Hawk,"No worries about the support - I'm here to help, not complain. My task is just to report the issues I find. If they stay broken for a while that's all part of alpha testing. :) I had already updated mono (currently 4.8.0.478/084f912). This was not an issue with the other builds, it's a problem with the hosted .zip archives being unstructured - the files and folders are all there, except they're in one huge pile instead of an ordered hierarchy. This one runs (-nogui) but it doesn't fix the 5.4 client directory tree which has also gone humpty dumpty. (Has someone been playing with their Klingon disruptor again?) I can see this server active in my LAN list if I launch the 5.3 client, but naturally that on is incompatible so I can't connect. I don't think it's a big problem, it just looks like someone knocked over a stack of punch cards (i.e., it's an organizational error rather than a flaw in the code). I don't know why nobody else ran into this issue. I tried re-downloading the archives from the main website but it seems they're damaged at the source. I could probably use previous versions as a template and perform some sorting hat magic on them, but it's 0230 so I was hoping elves would do it while I was sleeping. ;P EDIT: I'm up early so I rebuilt the tree and renamed the files, the client is working and connected to the 5.4 server now. I don't know why they fell apart but I'll rebuild the server directory and if the 4.6.2 framework is also in order I'll get back to testing on that one."

Steps to reproduce bug/issue: Place Mill
Client Version? [Alpha 5.4]
Server Crash 02045235.ecodmp
Client output_log.txt EDIT: SOLVED So I kept on testing this issue and it seems to be working fine if I place the mill in a room made of mortared stone and wood. Earlier I tried several times to place it in a room made of half wood and half dirt which causing the crashes. It's a bug that will still need to be addressed at some point but for now crashes can probably be avoided if the description of the mill is updated with type of room it requires (nothing in description currently).
P.S placing the Tailor table still causes crashes on client side only!"

bug-reports,Can't remove dead plants | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1479/can-t-remove-dead-plants,4523,6,4,Rezoken,"Dead plants are removed by using the Shovel, this is by design (digging out the dead roots etc). However, currently farming is broken in patch 5.3, and will still be broken in bug fix patch 5.4.  In the next major patch (which I believe is 5.5) it will be fixed. To replant, you will need to use the shovel to remove the dead plant, and then re-use the hoe.  If that does not work, try digging the dirt out and placing it back."

Been looking for endless amount of harsh/realistic survival games and none have really pleased me yet, maybe because I have played most of them too much. So I decided to give ECO a try! Went ahead and registered on the website and went on buying the starter edition (40$) through Paypal. Unfortunately, I came an error on Paypal;
""Sorry, we can’t complete your purchase at this time.
Please return to the merchant and choose another way to pay."" I don't know if the game is only available in the US, because I currently live in Europe. Maybe that is the case and it refuses it at the moment since it is still in Alpha.
Anyhow, would be nice to get an idea of whats happening with me.. ^^' I will wait on and try again later I think, or maybe wait for a Early Access Steam release. But that might be a long way ahead for it.

bug-reports,Server Issue | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1369/server-issue,1990,5,1,Koga Wolfe,"Alpha 5.1 Think my server may be beyond repair. Earlier today I got disconnected and when I tried logging in it got stuck on ""Connecting"", when I check the logs it said something about disconnecting due to inactivity and then that I was already logged in. I waited a while in hopes it would finish disconnecting me without having to restart the server, no luck. So I restart the server and try logging in but all objects are gone, doors, chests, crafting tables, ramps, etc. I also can't see the world beyond a short distance and when I go over the edge I just keep falling forever. I tried loading the earliest backup but it's the same thing. I have a backup I saved separately that works but it's from at least several days earlier or more so will lose a ton of progress if I have to use that one."

bug-reports,Server Issue | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1369/server-issue,1990,5,3,Koga Wolfe,"Was hoping there was some way to get the server fixed, understand it's an alpha but didn't expect needing to start over until the next big update. We lost about a week of progress so we've been thinking of starting over instead of just rebuilding, will learn from this though. Learned that the auto backup system you have is pretty much useless in its current state unless the issue happened in the past 2 hours or so and there is no way to change how often it backs things up, it just changes the values back to default. Will have to do manual backups each day so if something like this happens again it's only a single day lost."
bug-reports,Server Issue | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1369/server-issue,1990,5,4,NoBlackThunder,"Yea we are aware of even backups being broken .. the issue is the property system. That can be temporarily fixed by opening Game.eco with a zip app and deleting the property's folder. Sadly bugs like that  are a part of an alpha, but issue and comparability  problems are improving more and more. Eric is hard at work fixing that bug that breaks saves right now. Soon those critical issues should be a thing of the past Edit: edited the text above"
bug-reports,Server Issue | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1369/server-issue,1990,5,5,Koga Wolfe,"Just hotfixed my server, though it does have some errors when loading but they don't seem to prevent it from working. Your talk about the property folder in the Game.eco file got me to try out copying some of the files over from original server to my backup, copied plants, objects, users, and world from one game.eco file to the other and it seems to be working fine now. Just missing any new property claims, the time listed on the server lists shows the time of the backup and not the original, and the minimap is currently not showing the changes we made. I tried copying over more but the other files gave errors when loading up that crashed it. Looked in the code that popped up in the errors for keywords like time, chat, minimap, etc. and kept taking those out of the list I copied over until it worked. So it may not be perfect but we may not have to start over now. One interesting thing is that the Locked checkbox seems to be missing from objects already placed, placing them down again brings it back. EDIT: Looks like there may be other problems, while we can seem to update the world, the character doesn't seem to update, keep starting in the same spot with same inventory even after changing it. It was worth a shot at least, I may keep trying little things to fix, but if things won't save properly then it may not work."

Why? I have to pre-build everything in wood if I want a horizontal construction.
I am trying to aim blocks in a very cautionus way, but it doesn't really help at all.  I understand that there is a 'sliding'/'slippery' mechanic but it is just making it worse in this scenario. So I have to build one block up if I want to build further horizontal.
If I missed a stone road with horizontal construction, I would have to use pick axe and take it back with shovel. This is a cancer that can be cured.
If I had an ability to stick to the block - problem would be solved.
In Minecraft we had an ability to walk and during walk You were unable to fall down from a block.
I have to point out Minecraft bridge construction:https://youtu.be/P2tFJEE2axk?t=5m25s Perhaps an item like spiked shoes which would grant this kind of ability, or attaching a rope (too complex?). What do You guys think?"

bug-reports,Bridge construction is a cancer :| | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1344/bridge-construction-is-a-cancer,3213,7,6,ChronosWS,"There was an MC mod I liked which introduced scaffold blocks - they were blocks which were produced in bulk (like one wood could produce 16 or something), and they were fast to build and remove (for example, if you placed a scaffold where a scaffold already was, they stacked up to a certain height like 5, and if you removed the bottom one, all the others above it were also removed.)  They also could not be used to hold up any other blocks so they were not a substitute for structural building materials. The notion of a holographic blueprint is getting popular in some of the sci-fi games like Space Engineers.  Usually though they require you to have already built the thing and then create a blueprint from it - not so useful in the case of a bridge perhaps?"

bug-reports,5.3 bug reports | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1318/5-3-bug-reports,2135,6,1,Freds00n,"Bugs found so far Just doing a nice bundle of bugs i've found on our server - checked the other website but i can't seem to find these / i've putted in some general bugs as well with additional bugs we encountered. Kinda unorganized imo but it's better then nothing. :) Dead elks
On our server - we've found numerous dead elks. Strange thing here is that they are not dead, but alive. They have become a rag doll themselves. Multiple players reported seeing those and they seem to increase when playing longer (more lagg - less FPS, need a restart. Memory loss?). The thing is; if you actually shoot them with a bow, a random elk carcass will appear in the vicinity which can be looted. They also seem to spawn in herds a lot which causes a lot of lag issues (only 150 elk on server) combined with this issue - causes huge FPS issues and eventually i have to restart my game because of it (no map open). Carpentry items not working as intendedThe chair, the table, the shelves,... they all don't seem to work and give their stats to other crafting tables - not even the ones intended for the carpentry table. Our carpentry guy has reported it, i've also noticed it. They don't work. Tried pulling tables up again, putting down furniture twice,... it just doesn't work BUT: they do say they are in the room (check table status ; they are noticed as modules - see stove picture below). The item requirement items do seem to work properly, just not the statted ones. Wooden cart and roads
Probably know so far but they are very buggy - not even them but the roads are buggy as well. Things i've noticed so far: WOODEN CART
Extremely buggy in all it's ways. Can't drive when put down (wheels stuck), multiple deeds, gets sucked up by cubes (is still there, just need to remove the cube), when going out of drive mode the cart flies a bit in the air - sometimes higher sometimes lower...
They also seem to glitch out by themselves if you keep them in the world instead of picking them up - your cart will most likely be somewhere else then the place you've put it. I also noticed that any cart can get thrown away by any animal it encounters (especially if not ridden). We have elks spawning in the city and at several occasions they run through carts and the carts bug out / fly away / flipped over. It's just buggy but the ""solution"" is; get a powered cart. They are very stable compared to wooden carts - haven't had a lot of issues yet compared to the wooden cart. ROADS
Dirt roads seem to be the buggiest of them all but eventually the ""wheels stuck in road bug"" is still there over all. I must say there are significant differences at times. While STONE road ramps are put near each other (one ramp going up - one ramp going down), sometimes
some ramps will dissapear (they are completely gone - there is a hole). If you remove one of the ramps on the road which goes down (closest to road going up) the other two ramps reappear. Seems to happen at times but placing a dirt ramp solves it all. Other then that we're going to test asphalt as well. Don't mind the sign it's not caused by that, without the sign it also happened and it happens when you go out of vision range / spawn range (?) of the blocks AND if you put them down manually - invisible. Check the vid - in general it's just the beginning and ending. http://plays.tv/video/5873a9d5efd4415e26/bug-stone-ramp Also the STONE RAMP corners are bugged ; the corners are a bit larger then normal so you often get stuck on them. If you look closely to the left and right side of the above corners of the ramp you'll see them being a bit larger then the road.http://imgur.com/B4YPP84 Agriculture
Someone on the server told me beans are the only working plant so far - we still have to test it. Other then that the aquaduct also seems to work but hoeing an area doesn't  (other plants will grow on it - you can plant but there will be issues with multiple plants). Tested a couple of plants - they do receive growing bonus but they die eventually. We should test this soon with beans. Tree trunk not harvestable
Sometimes the tree trunk shows an orange border around it - one can harvest it the other can't. If you leave it you can sometimes harvest it later as well. Seems to happen very rarely but if it happens you're sometimes stuck with a tree trunk. Asking someone else does help at times but not all the time. Even when all branches are removed - but even when they are not (normal) but you also can't remove them. The last thing mostly happens when the tree falls on a different item which is high - a piece of mountain, an other tree. It's sort of still standing. Oftenly also just on the ground, idk it seems random.http://imgur.com/5SorPKf INSIDE MOUNTAIN ramp teleport bug
We've had this very strange issue where that, if we (with wooden cart or without - wooden cart 100% teleport, i did it twice check video for preview. Powered cart doesn't seem to teleport at all.) we're trying to cross the ramp, we instantly got teleported all the way on top of the mountain. I'm not sure but i think it has to do with the STONE RAMP again. We replaced it with dirt ramps and the issue seems to be gone for now. You just approached, came to a specific spot on the ramp and teleported on top of the mountain.The ceiling was high enough, nothing was blocking, road ahead was long enough,... Might be because of underground being cut or just the stone ramps in general, not sure. It's a 4x2 ramp site- so you have four ramps going down, two ramp wide road.http://imgur.com/wFDvKjg http://plays.tv/video/5873adbf811eb40644/bug-mountain-teleport Shop bug
Had it multiple times but only in one specific shop - the carpentry shop in our town. At times you get disconnected and if you try it again later on (like an hour or so) you don't. Multiple people reported this bug on our server and it happened at times with multiple people and later on we could just shop again without any issue. There seems to be an issue with the stack amount you're getting or smth, that's what our carpenter said. I'm still not sure how this bug works. I tried putting logs in my hand - went out of server. I tried putting it in the store - went out of server. Tried putting it in container -> shop - went out. It's so weird, it happens and it doesn't. I haven't had an issue in my own shop or in other shops - just with the carpentry items. Doesn't seem to matter which quantity either - yesterday i crashed when i was picking up one chair / table with a couple of logs. After the crash you also didn't receive your item you bought but you still have your stuff as well. When i log back in i sometimes got stuck in his house as well - had to unstuck. The shop does seem normal so idk what's going on.http://imgur.com/FPSuKWy Table requirements
One small issue here: the stove status page is a little bugged. It shows different tekst multiple times (out of fuel, # of modules, meets room requirements). I'm even looking at it right now and one says it is fueled, the other says it isn't lol. Other then that it functions normally.http://imgur.com/FpxInGv Chest
An other small thing perhaps ; but for some reason i can put (especially ore) 'inside' the chest ; the location it is standing at (don't mind the above trees that's a previous picture...).http://imgur.com/msSCuV4 UPDATE 1:WOODEN + POWERED CART STUCK BUG
Sometimes they (powered + wooden) don't want to drive but i figured out it happens at the same time as the wooden cart. Me and a friend were driving a wooden cart and a powered cart. They both were stuck at the same time when they stood still somewhere - and they both unstucked at the same time as well. Just to let you know it just isn't the wooden cart alone. MOUNTAIN TELEPORT BUG
Confirmed, ONLY stone ramps do this. The dirt ramps don't seem to do this and asphalt doesn't either. Powered cart + Wooden cart. ASPHALT ROADS
The asphalt RAMPS don't seem to give the desired efficiency to carts as they should be (also seen this bug report somewhere). They give the efficiency of the block underneath the ramp - so if it anything else then road you're basically stuck because you can't move - no road efficiency. CHEST More information
The chest problem; you can't put other items in other items (like put iron ore 'in' a table, in the open world) but you can put iron ore 'underneath' the chest. The ground space is still green underneath the chest so if you are shoveling ore for example; there is a possibility that the ore will be placed on the block where the chest is standing one, in other words, inside the chest (open world, as you see in the picture). Not that it's a big deal but just to let you know  to fix the box radius a bit. ^^ That's the list so far. :) Greetings Freds00n"

I think you can tell it happens because when cart bounces up into air when you leave go i think its kind of prepositions its self due to clipping but sometimes i think it just causes cart to go nuts and float or get stuck I also starting get fleeing that if it clips it causes the cart to just disappear, as in why removing the road or block will make it reappear sometimes. it is really noctive able if you on a road and you take a turn due to fact that the cart turns like a semi truck it ends up clipping off the road blocks cuz roads turn at right angles and carts do not turn like that. I think if the carts where allowed to be pushed even if they clip something or if wheels do not touch ground it may help this problem at least for time being it could help see if that is issue or not if all problems go away when this is allowed that would narrow issue down."

I had it on multiple occasions where i was doing road construction and i removed a road block and a cart appeared lol. There's also differences between the road types as i've noticed - dirt seems to be the buggiest of them all. We have stone now which seems to work fairly good - but it's still buggy. Wheels might still get stuck and such or bounces up in the air... I do have to say - once you have the powered cart most of these issues dissapear. It's much more stable.

So: It happened yesterday and many, many times today (almost all night, I may say). You try to place an item (by item I mean the purple deployable items, e.g. cart, store, sign, door, etc. Then the green image of the item (that you see right before placing it) just freezes to the point it was the moment you clicked. All you can do is to (A) move your camera, (B) move around, (C) open the chat (by pressing 'Enter'). What it does not work, pretty much everything. You cannot interact with the environment, not select any of your items, not open storage facilities, not type on the chat (even though it seems to be working at first). You can still see messages from other people. After 10-20 sec you'll get booted off the server, receiving an ""inactivity"" error message. As you can imagine, this is HUGE issue, since it makes the game literally unplayable (not being able to deploy anything). I read that you are about to release new updates, so perhaps it has to do with that. It occurred while cutting a tree. I could not pick up one of the cut pieces that was lying on the dirt. Also, I could not cut it to more pieces, even though I hit it many times with my axe. At first I thought it was the cart-type bug (getting stuck in some item, whether it's dirt or road or ramp or whatever), but I could actually move it around by pushing it. Eventually, I managed to pick it up successfully after 1-2 re-launches of the game. This happens again with **purple / deployable items, such as carts/shelves, chests, signs, etc. If you are put (either by you or by default after production) into a stack, there is a very high chance WHEN YOU deploy an item from this stack, to remove all the stack afterwards. If you pick it up again, you get back only 1 item, meaning you lost X-1 items (where X is the number you had before deploying). This does not happen if you have same items in your inventory but NOT on a stack / same stack. Very rare issue. Happened only 1-2 times few days ago. I was removing / re-placing ramps on a know buggy spot. After few trials, game crashed and kicked me off the server. When I re-login the ramp is not there (never appeared) and I did not have it back into my inventory. All these happened on the R4World server. I might add more if I remember anything else."

Although i'm not as knowledgeable as you all are I hope I could be of some assistance in some way as I would still like to see this game prosper and flourish. Also, unfortunately all the people I would like to refer to try this game are mac users so I can't see myself promoting it until the bug is fixed to spare them the same fate I have met. At the current moment I won't be requesting a refund or anything of the sort as i'm sure this issue is something fixable.

bug-reports,5.2 Can't shoot bow | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1270/5-2-can-t-shoot-bow,1834,8,1,Freds00n,"Reported this bug on the 5.2 patch notes thread as well, but after all this is a bug so i'll post it here as well.
So the problem here is that you can't shoot any kind of animal with your bow.
The main reason behind this problem is the fact that you can harvest other resources but only if you are close enough (when the green/red/orange line around the resource appears). In other words: you can't kill a running bunny, elk, bison,... because you're not close enough to 'harvest the resource'. Now, for those who still want to play on a 5.2 server. Current 'solution'
Bit time consuming but instead of meat;Charred Camas Bulb + Charred Beet: both offer the needed fat and protein from meat.
At 70~ SP you'll be maxed out on Camas Bulb -> smash some wood with an axe and repeat (put it down, smash it,...). Lose calories! Makes it easier to gain SPs faster early on.
Only thing you need to focus on early game is the Campfire Cooking skill, make sure it is level 2 (requires 5 points -> don't put a point in hunting just yet). Once you can produce charred beet you'll gain 0.4+ SP. Currently at 80~, after 80 +0.3.UPDATE: Around 85-90 you're basically stuck. Switching between both seems to give 0.2 or more/less sometimes... Pretty hard to level up. You'll go up and down a lot. Currently at 90UPDATE 2: After 90 you're forced to switch between both, the one increasing your SP by 0.2, the other reducing it by 0.1. This way you'll only receive 0.1 per two vegies. Currently at 92,3."

I put the mill back to original location and it doesn't work either. it is written on the mill: it is written on the windmill: but there is no power, when windmill is above the mill 3-7 blocks away. outdated wiki says: There is no such thing written in game.
Under the normal workbench there is a tooltip 'how to place it properly' So the mill have to be inside or outside?
If outside - then how to connect it? how to power it up? There was similar problem I believe:http://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1147/power

sometimes I will notice someone logging on and it crashing with in seconds after words then they log on again and it crashes again over and over. - I am thinking that sometimes item placements are causing problems with the server."

Go into the Configs folder in your server and edit WorldGenerator.eco with the seed and dimensions you want, then it'll start up with that and you won't have to regenerate to change the seed. My thinking is that this makes it so it doesn't already have another map seed saved somewhere that can overlay onto the one you're playing on, thus no floating lands.

bug-reports,5.1 water irrigation bug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1222/5-1-water-irrigation-bug,1702,4,4,midn8t,"well these blocks have sate over night I dog that out ran water next to blocks and even have block underwater but they still read same as when i put them there and ran water 50 to 58 percent which is same as the blocks that are 10 blocks away from the water.  I would think that blocks that are under water should read higher then 50% ? I guess I do not understand water concept in this game.. blocks that are high up in the hills with no water source at all have a 78% and waters next to and in lakes have less ?  I mean blocks are same 100% as they where last night before i dug the trench to bring water to them and even lowered the area to be closer to water but blocks on top and blocks under and all blocks are always same it seems. ?
the berry bush there died due to water issues moister rating was not high enough. at least according to the tool the water is right under block the bush is in and next to the block. the bush need rating of 78 and the block stayed at rating of 56 which was in rang of the block rating before I moved it into the water last night . for some reason I think the farming might not be working due to water issues with planets maybe. it just seems like no matter how much water you send to blocks there not getting the water and planets you planet just end up dieing. I just do not under stand how irrigation works in this game i guess.. "

50,50 water level 25 and height 100 i even bumped it up to 60 by 60 seems like unless you have it generating world size of 100,100 you do not get much in shape of trees or jungles on 50 by 50 and 60 by 60 be enough trees maybe for two people three people probably be pushing it. giant open areas with no trees and all trees be in one general area that one person take up majority of whit there first 10 zones. what it did seem to fix is mini map,, I have not had issue with mini map sense 5.1 so far.. even with resting the server five times and regenerating the world. the performance for this game is alot better with the new default of 50,50 world size map height is bit high for world this small but like i stated above biggest issue is tree population it just dose not happen on smaller worlds much at all. the five times i regenerate world not once did a jungle area appear. anyways what did seem to get fixed is the mini map and there was good amount of performance pick up. editing to add more issues below  I put 1 point into carpentry  but research tree says i have zero points in it and it did not unlock anything.  can not use logs in fire place any more ?

bug-reports,Chunk lost Collision | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1208/chunk-lost-collision,941,2,1,Diosys,"Reporting a rather obnoxious bug I encountered today while playing, which was confirmed as not being a desync issue with the server by the owner of said server. During play, a large portion of my house lost the entirety of its collision detection. Basically, you could walk through blocks and when you hit a floor with no detection, you fell through the world. I performed the following actions in the last 5 minutes before the issue started:
Put a windmill on my house
Tested Mill by making 1 flour
removed 4 log blocks to gain access to my roof
Put down 8-9 log blocks as I was building a tower for the windmill At this point, the chunk area lost all of its collision. The only action I performed afterword was removing the windmill. I tried to disconnect/Quit Game/Reconnect to check if it was a desync issue. The server owner came over and confirmed he would also fall through the world when walking in the area. After about 10 minutes and the server owner replacing several log blocks with mortared stone for the floor, the blocks became walkable again."

It does seem like this issue is server specific, I have gotten on other servers in both 5.3 and 5.4 just fine, as well as locally running a 5.3 server.

I don't have any noticeable memory leakage in any other circumstance. Thinking in hindsight, it's dawning on me that the issue might be related to claimed territory, as at one point I made the server force restart once or twice due to the bakery messing things up. When it happened, I lost my territory claims (all my deeds lost their metadata), but the other person on the server didn't for some reason. It might be that when I walked into their territory, the server might've gotten confused at the land claim and made some change that causes a memory leak/hole for anyone loading in the area? Just a stab in the dark, but the most plausible thing I can come up with. If you want to see the issue for yourself, it's on the Happy Hour server at ExdDs land claim (I also met him on another server incidentally and he had the same issue)."

I mean schools around here are no longer even buying computer systems for the schools due to budget cuts. there removing the computers and replacing them with ipads and in local schools in area are even cutting out writing classes.. because moneys not there and school board as i quote computers are not future mobile devices are they even cut out the typing classes. I am not sure how education and technology is in other states or in other country but WI I went for a job work at Milton school dis in WI it was server admin/ help desk, so I asked what job would need me to do they just removed all there servers, they removed all there computer systems what job required was someone to help support apple Ipads all servers are cloud and only for the ipad software. the school dis around here are under contract to only buy and have apple products mobile products. so i honestly hope they put game aspects first and the learning lessons second and sticks to one main goal to teach and accomplish so that game brings in the masses for sales and focus maybe on private school and home learning. which means it really needs to be fun and challenging first"

I mean honestly sometimes I just do not get logic in this game somethings seem to try push hardcore game play mechanics and other things are so relaxed its not even funny like Dragonshifty said hopefully they add sometype health system and air system to the game so that things like fall damage can happen, injury's, and keep us form breathing underwater."

I guess that is what irritating about way tools are right now there locked behind skills and you have to sometimes wait for days to be able to use one even thought you have knowledge where you should be able to do it.  it the whole waiting for skills is when its something you need for a different profession is just bothersome. so for example this would not take this long but in latter on in game this happens more often. I am doing farming i have bunch skills in it but now  i cant farm because i need shovel to unlock shovel I need to wait for hour . but i only have so much time to play game so ill just log off and play again tomorrow or ill just log off for a week wait till i have 100 skill points then log on and spend them as i need it. its not really fun and it ends up hampering the game play specially with tools locked away behind the skills. maybe put all the tools behind a crafting skill of some type like wood working. heres anther example so I am testing with my own server game play little, I start up the server log in and first thing i do now stick point into chopping trees, stick point in for the shovel stick point for pix axe then  i spend all my points then i clear my area build a house and then i sit around jercking while i wait for anther point to build a unlock wood craft table then what do i do eat bunch stuff and logg off for next hour or so while i wait for points. rather be playing game but I can not really do anything got get two points for research table then after that i can do little something then i need more points so i log off and wait. it is a waiting game and its really bad if you need tools scattered all around skill tree. the skill system should take on a more fuild system where it rewards game play and allows you to keep playing if you want to, when i or a kid sits down they should be able to play it none stop no waiting should be able to do anything you want just like in real life. - you may not be good at it but you should be able to do it and game be way more fun with that type of system do what you want how you want you may not be good at it but you can at least do it and get better at it. then people who are better at it could create books to artificial incress peoples skills at doing those things."

I dont think that this error can come up in game but must come up when you try to access the law page as an example .. since that is browser controlled and this is happening on every server for you (?) i believe there must be something wrong with your computer at this stage... But i need more information about this

Feel free to reply to this thread to add more feedback/bugs and help make reported bugs more accurate. UNCONFIRMED BUGS Property claims can be ""forgotten"" by the server. I'm not sure how or when this happened, but last night I had claimed some property and tonight I have no land claimed, but the deed item still exists - it just points to nothing. I know the server has crashed/restarted since last night, so it could be the data is lost during a crash. Sometimes when gathering, the plants do not disappear, but the items are still added to your inventory. When underground, should a block be placed on your head, you'll automatically teleport to the surface. @midn8t ""also issue with deed markers and research who ever gets on the server first and does all research the quickest gets all markers, every one else who then joins server automatically gets skills unlocked so they can not read the books to get markers them selfs."" - This hasn't been an issue on my server AFAICT, confirmation from others would be helpful. Fastest (graphic settings) still doesn't save, but the resolution does now in the launcher. Placing a workbench will place the bench, but not use the item in inventory. However, when attempting to place the ""used"" bench item to another inventory, item simply disappears. When using the workbench, if I have 10 dirt in my inventory and set an order for 10 peat roof (using all 10 dirt) I receive an error message stating I don't have all the necessary materials. I can however, create 10 individual orders for 1 peat roof each. CONFIRMED BUGS MAJOR BUGS
This: http://i.imgur.com/Tih8hsu.jpg (occurred after getting kicked trying to place a store). Chests are no longer private and cannot be locked. They can be accessed by anyone regardless of owner permissions. This in itself isn't a problem as it gives players a reason to make, use and lock doors. The problem is that chests can still be accessed through walls. Chests need to be buried underground and/or away from external walls in order to be secure. Placing a store will kick you from the server: ""Caught exception: Constructor on type Eco.Gameplay.Components.PrivateStorageComponent not found."" The store is not placed. Birch trees drop cedar seeds. Work tables (workbenches and research tables so far) can be accessed despite not being in a room. I actually like I can access their inventories at any time, but the restriction when it comes to work orders should probably work. Wood stairs currently cost nothing to build. Pending work orders cannot be cancelled. If a connection to a server should fail, the message can be cleared, but the server list will not reappear. This can only be fixed with a client restart. Time seems to be stuck at 8am. Sound and music volume seem to enjoy setting themselves to zero. MINOR BUGS
Description for arrows in the workbench reads ""Use with the bow to hunt for food (or amaze your friends by shooting arrows off of their heads)."" Grammar error: Should read ""...shooting arrows off their heads"". In the skills window, upper tab, the list of cards detailing different skill trees should display the number of levels you've invested into each tree. Currently, they all register zero, regardless of actual skill level. Edit: It seems these figures only update after client reconnect/server restart. FEEDBACK I miss the music from alpha 4. Any chance on getting that track added to the game's jukebox again? Property claim flags still do not offer any visual clue where they have been placed within the game world. Adding something to confirm their placement would be really, really useful. When right-clicking on a campfire (or fuel-consuming craft object) with wood/fuel in hand, please make the fuel automagically transfer to the power tab, rather than the inventory tab."

Never even implied.  Never even tried.  I just wanted to help. You feeling like an idiot is all on you.  Second I Asked if you might have typed it wrong.  I didn't say you did. I didn't demand you did.  I didn't even assume you did.  If you felt that way. It's on you.  Lastly I would never call someone an idiot.  Stupid.  Or anything.  I've never caled someone a name beside by brothers or maybe super close friends.  And Even then it's mostly a joke.  I love all people's and even bad people as its human nature to make a mistake.  My favorite thing to do is help people.  Next To that I like to argue when people are being rude just because it's hilarious. Yes I know this makes me no better then you but I am ok with that.  Are you? To summarize. I didn't call you an idiot.  You did.

It happened today and after trying everything I could I finally went to work. When I came home the opening of the game was me falling through the world and then landing back its surface exactly outside of my doorway. I then went on a scavenging trip and during that fell through the world and back onto the surface again. Got home put some things in storage and was trying to go outside again when i fell and got stuck under the surface again. I cant dig myself out or chop myself out I am stuck in this glitched out spot. I can access my chest somehow and it seems to pull out random things and I can put them back in. Need help.

A lot of the lag can be attributed to animals not EVER being removed, even when you move out of range of them. Hence the floating horizon of animals. The number of animals created by the simulation is also being rebalanced, though those numbers were inflated by some incorrect grass placement in a lot of cases. Both of those things are being fixed. The data given by the farming tool, seed tooltip, and most things that draw from world layers are giving incorrect information due to an extremely minor bug. This should also be fixed. No promises, but we're looking to get a fix out for those things (which are fairly major bugs) by tomorrow. I wanted to let you all know that we're fixing these bugs and we appreciate the advanced testing you guys are doing! We do read this stuff and it helps a ton when figuring out what's going wrong and what to prioritize. Almost forgot!

i personally rather see the progress and help with some bugreports than have nothing released and wait another couple weeks until a fully working version. but each to their own. you cant magically throw out a bugfree version if you dont have one.
i think being transparent here and including the community is a great move from SLG, instead of going the ""sorry we have to push it another 4 weeks""-route.
this is alpha after all, thats what i signed up for early."

We are stuck at 8:00 am on day one and it's not moving forward any. Does anyone know of any remedies to help fix this? My guess its a bug in the alpha stage or something in the server config files.

bug-reports,Alpha 5 Bugs/quarks | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1022/alpha-5-bugs-quarks,16667,35,33,panisch,"i dont think the tree seed droprate was unreasonably low in 4.2. i wouldnt mind it going a bit lower. if you have a tree farm, they grow leaves right away and you get alot of seeds quickly.
however what id like to see is a benefit from seed yield. not the flat +1 / the same ratio you get from plants tho, that would be too much imo. eventually they will have to tweak the way most of the yield skills work anyway if you ask me. current concept is totally fine for alpha, but suboptimal overall."
bug-reports,Alpha 5 Bugs/quarks | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1022/alpha-5-bugs-quarks,16667,35,34,craig.jong,"One of the key aspects of the game is the way players interact with and take from the environment: how their actions change the ecosystem and how that influences the availability of resources/state of the world. Both the droprate of seeds and the growth rate of trees are both important in reinforcing this concept and will be likely be tweaked quite a bit as we move forward. Tree farms should be seen as a method of supplementing, not replacing, deforestation for later wood-related uses. That all said, I don't think the drop rate for tree seeds should have changed between 4.2 and 5 pre3."

bug-reports,a5p3 access-range on worktable-ui should be increased | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1062/a5p3-access-range-on-worktable-ui-should-be-increased,2258,6,1,panisch,"so a5p1 had this bug of an unlimited access-range, this was obviously a cheat and not good.
a5p2 had it fixed but you couldnt open 2 benches at the same time. a5p3 fixes both, but the range in which the ui automatically closes is too short imo. the current radius in which you can use a table is barely 2 blocks around the table. iirc in a4.2 the radius was somewhere around 4-5 blocks.
i think we need more than 2 blocks because one wont always be able to put synergizing worktables right next to eachother, but in adjacent rooms. the current radius would be too small to open 2 workbenches in adjacent rooms at the same time. it would require to manually put the materials from the table into personal inventory, then walking from 1 table to another to then put the materials from the personal inventory into the table."

One of the things we are trying to move more towards is the concept of 'linked' inventories, where if you are within X radius of something with an inventory, you can access it.

anyway, very glad to see that you guys are seeing the flaws of the current storage system and are working on improvements - however they may turn out! i also thought about something like linking stores to chests aswell to increase the storage of that store. (but that was with the weight system from 4.2, not sure how important this would be with the ""new"" system where the number of storage slots are the limiting factor)"

Can't pick up wood, can't play the game. So I'm stuck until either 1. a server redo or 2. I find another to play on and don't research the wood that adds lumber to your yield. It was frustrating."
bug-reports,5.0 minutia | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1057/5-0-minutia,1018,2,1,Furbal,"Some of the things I've found so far with 5.0: You still can't ""drop"" something from your inventory. You have no way of reducing what you are carrying without putting it ""in"" something. Why? Am I missing the simplest thing here? When carrying anything it seems in the ""hands"" slot, for example when you chop some lumber and pick it up, I can't see where I'm going to put it because the graphic for it takes over the center of the screen where my target would be if I could see it. In 4.2 I got around this by selecting the hammer and then placing it because it would disappear and I could see. No such luck now. When chopping a log and nothing but tools and workbenches in my inventory I got the message ""Can't pick up. Inventory full"". No such case existed and i simply chopped the piece of log again, lost part of it because it was too small and therefore I lost wood, and then it became small enough to pick up. It was green the entire time so I SHOULD have been able to pick it up to start with. This is another game-play area I've mentioned before.  There's no reason why you shouldn't be able to put wood or whatever into your inventory to move it around. The limits currently in place make for a play session full of frustration rather than fun. I get you are trying to push an educational twist to the game. That's great. Now, if you want to make some money at it, you need to make it playable as a GAME. Think about it, does the amount of wood you can carry in your inventory really matter to the overall theme of impact to environment? No it doesn't, but it sure does make it a lot more fun to play when you can harvest an entire tree or two and THEN move on to where you were building instead of making 5,000 trips... I know I'm exaggerating but it was to push the point that maybe reality and fiction need to blend more where they can and not compromise the overall learning objectives of the game. When harvesting elk, I get Elk Carcasses, not meat. I haven't figured out why yet but then I haven't built up a whole lot yet either.. i'll see when I get a butcher's table made maybe... Last thing. The cheat mode. I use this to speed up how fast i and the couple that play with me go through the game. It's not just to make life easy, it's to make it so we can get to later content faster to give actual feedback in a timely fashion. We don't have entire days to spend playing, we have maybe hours.  Fast forwarding an 18 hour research book to instant really is a big deal to us. That's how we found the bug where in the advanced kitchen stuff you couldn't place actual work tables with the ""other"" tables like the mill in the same room because they all counted as work tables and couldn't be in the same space... but it was the later tables that had the problem, not the earlier ones. I had the mill and butcher's table along with up to 2 other tables like the research and first carpenter's table and it all worked fine... but put them into a kitchen and forget it... Is that an error or not? Why can a mill be placed anywhere but you can't put it in the kitchen along with the oven and the butcher's table... they are all kitchen stuff! All that being said, I hope there's something there you developers can use. I stress erring towards game playability rather than reality. You've got a neat idea with a great artistic pallet that people will like... just make it playable."
bug-reports,5.0 minutia | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1057/5-0-minutia,1018,2,2,pan7s,"right now you are just not meant to be able to drop things. i dont know why. my personal thoughts is so people dont waste anything. its all about the planet aand if you could say just throw away something to no where then it is taken away from the ecosystem forever. i actual like the system for carrying heavier things. without it, it would be way to easy. it gives you a reason for carts and thus roads which will take away portions of the ecosystem just so you can get stuff around easier. the log chopping is an issue in 5.0 and its known. its a bug. welcome to early access. also 5.0 is a bit more flawed then 4.2.1. i would stay with 4.2.1 if this is an issue for you. in 5.0 you get the carcass and cook it at the campfire. not sure the exact thinking on the mill. but i think that is more an outside station. kind of like the bloomery or campfire. although i think that when a bloomery or campfire is inside, it creates less pollution. dont quote me on that. but you can only have 2 stations inside a room at once. funny some things like a mill that dont need a room count as a station but a campfire that dont need a room does not count as one. its all real early access. they know of a lot of issues which is why they did not release 5.0v3 on time more then likely. if you want a playable version like i said before maybe stick with 4.2.1 untill 5.0 is worked out a little more some things you dislike are actually a huge part of the game like picking things up in certain amounts. and some things are just bugs/ the result of playing early access. I cant wait untill the game is worked out a little better but for now i stick with 4.2.1 as it is pretty solid. enjoy!"

It came to my mind just because I was wondering how come I had a different colour icon than most of the other players I see typing in chat.
The vast majority have a gold icon while some (me included) have a silver one.
I assume that these are based on the game tier we bought, is that right? It that's the case, should they not be colourcoded according to the list displayed on the webpage? For instance, I have dev access pack and in game it displays a silver icon while my cousin bought a duo pack with a friend and he has a gold icon. As I said in the opening, it's a super minor thing :P Not sure if it's meant to change with users which will buy the game once it's in Beta and if the one that get the final release will have an icon at all.

bug-reports,Raw Meat Not Possible? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1033/raw-meat-not-possible,3967,12,1,Karellen,I've been searching through the forums and github if this has been posted but i can't find it so....  I assume that you get raw meat from using a carcass on a butchers table but it says you need raw meat to get the butchery skill.  Is there some other way to get raw meat or is this progression part broken?

However that seems to have been updated by a player rather than an admin/dev.   Perhaps it was a different bug? I'm finding posting bugs pretty difficult on here and tracking who has posted what.

bug-reports,Unlimited Property Claim Flags | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1013/unlimited-property-claim-flags,9023,22,5,midn8t,I my self have not ran into this to much most of games I have played you never even see people who are playing. game rewards you so much for not playing by how you generate skill points you only come online to eat then log off and wait again then just spend those points like nuts - you do not even really do anything. so I have not really seen it as big issue so far other then once that start rewarding people for playing and people start really building and doing things then perhaps it be issue. but right now best way to play is to further your technology as fast as you can and best way to do that is eat bunch stuff to get you a 130 Percent skill points every hour then just log off. then you just wait and log on and up your tech and log off agin.
bug-reports,Unlimited Property Claim Flags | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1013/unlimited-property-claim-flags,9023,22,6,darkensign,"Why 130%, not 200%? Also, if you only ever log on to eat, then log off again, who builds your stuff?"
bug-reports,Unlimited Property Claim Flags | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1013/unlimited-property-claim-flags,9023,22,7,midn8t,"I just said you log in eat log off gain skill points then do quick build, you only need to build stuff to raise tech level not anything extra so room here room there put thing in it but only if you need it to up level - once you get over the building and mine craft stuff and you just want power level up that is how you do it. haven't pushed it to 200 and there is no real need to do so. honestly there no need to even get it up to 100 it just matter of real life time just keep logged off till you get amount of power leveling skill points you want, then when you collect total amount you want build some stuff if you really want too. but I do not play on any servers that have meteor turned on so there time limit or need to do anything and a lot of servers tend to turn feature off it seems. I have chars on 7 servers only need put half or so in on each per day - you can accomplish more by playing less at the start and once you got you skill point saved up spend them as needed game starts move along a lot faster by doing that. you also do not need a lot of area best spot to build zone is top of highest spots because then you get all resources going straight down  just dig it all out and put some wood or stone over whole and dig straight down and out on top of that buildings do not have to be built above ground you can dig out area and build your levels below ground only requirement for rooms are to be surround by walls. Also then sense you have a pool of 400 plus skill points if you need tree just power level spend skill points on agricultural and grow some trees on your small plot of land just level up crazy plant then log off and wait or grow them under the water so people do not know they are there or underground. most people do not build under water you can live underwater - there no death in this game so you can build take anything any where any place.  I got trees growing under water on my one server along with my whole underwater dungeon house. there a lot of tricks and things you can do to get places to build. you can also create teleporters in game  if you deep underground and you want get up to surface quick just pix axe rock above your head it push you down through world and you end up on the surface. in fact almost anything that would normal kill you in real life or in any other game usually creates some weird effect in this game. the new patch might change things but as of right now whole thing is broken to point where you can do anything and you do not need to do a lot to get it done. anyways off optic funniest thing I ever did in this game I had this road near my mine it open pit mine of course and i let go of cart and me and cart went flying up in air because that os what game does when you leave go of a cart of course , so here I am at bottom of my mine with cart on my head so i have to slowly dig out an area to move cart into that underground then some how I was able to grab cart so then i use pix axe and then I dropped the ceiling on me and cart and we both went falling through the ground and ended up on surface. The game right now is pretty freaking hilarious right now at times."
bug-reports,Unlimited Property Claim Flags | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1013/unlimited-property-claim-flags,9023,22,8,pan7s,Just because that's the way you play don't mean that's how everyone plays. We had a server with plenty active players.  We all played hard. No one just quick built.  We all put love and time into our plots. Either way you are way off topic. Both times people ended up spamming land claims all over. Oh a nice forest? Mine. Nice beach? Mine. Had someone claim so much I felt the need as well. Then we had people wondering about.  Now just cause you just log on to eat and leave don't mean that's what others are doing.  Unlimited claims is a problem. I'm sure they are fixing

We are not dying as players. It's about the planet.  I don't see how planting a tree underwater is more of an issue then someone claiming a whole map. I feel you have not played multiplayer enough.  Or the game enough to understand what it is about.  Of course what it is about to me could be different then you.  But I feel like dying will never be a thing.  The game to me is about learning,  being creative,  working together as a community,  developing relationships.  None of this has to do with death nor is needed.  This game seems to be milder.

bug-reports,Unlimited Property Claim Flags | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1013/unlimited-property-claim-flags,9023,22,12,pan7s,The point of the Game is to stop a meteor from destroying the planet while not destroying it yourself.  You do need to eat which consumes the environment.  Just cause you don't die don't mean it's bad. It's not meant for a health bar. The way you play sounds like you play on a solo map with no meteor or other players.  You just log on.  Eat food.  And log off. Sounds like a blast.  Of course to you this stuff with claim flags is not important.  But it is a major major fault in the game when you consider playing on public servers. I will not give any more opinion. You can think what you will.  And I will think what I will. And I think you should play the game more before telling other people what is needed or not.  I just don't see you having much knowledge of the game. None the less. Good day sir and happy gaming :)

And with a meteor the point is to work together to stop it without destroying the world yourself.  It's about the world not the player.  When the player eats or tries to build to stop the meteor the player has to take from natural resources.  Weather or not the player can die is irrelevant to the game. As it still causes you to take from the environment. Death or no death the effects to the planet would be the same thus making death irrelevant. I feel we are way off topic again.

Related to the claim flag bug i think it sould be fixed before the game gets on steam early access.

bug-reports,Weights are a bit unbalanced | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/969/weights-are-a-bit-unbalanced,2729,8,1,Furbal,"This is another thing I'm not sure is a bug but I can't find any theory on it with a quick search: The weights of the various items are far beyond reasonable for most items. A shovel full of stone will never weight 30kg but even taking into account a larger scale, when you put in the mix ingredients that add up to 31kg (one stone, one pitch to make one Mortared Stone) you don't get an end product that weights 50kg.  This is specifically the Mortared Stone recipe. The other thing is the storage capacity in everything. A chest at 4000kg holds roughly 130 +/- a few Iron Ore. For the Whole chest. Far too low. I'd think starting a chest at the 10,000 mark would make far more sense. The tables themselves should hold no less than 10,000 worth of items. The meat table is a prime example of how the number of storage slots are also far too few. I have gathered roughly 450ish meats. To make them into raw sausage I need a minimum of 10 more slots to accommodate the returned items... and that's with zero bonuses to production and I am maxed so were I to actually queue the entire 450 i'd need probably several dozen slots to hold the resulting items. Make the storage slots dynamic if you don't want to have static place holders. Again, I'm a large scale operations kind of person so I don't do anything fast or in low quantities. Right now I have over 400 iron ore sitting because I have no where to put it to process it. An alternative to weight for purposes of capacity... especially since you are trying to make this a viable GAME as well as an educational tool is to change over to number of slots. Make a chest have 12 slots. It can hold 12 stacks of whatever but only 12. Weight doesn't mater. For the various vehicles, make the hand cart hold 6 or 8 slots, the powered double that and so on. Forget weight to make it easy and for game play. Fix the weights if you really feel they are important to the game although, I see no lesson with them at the moment. Thank you for your time again."
bug-reports,Weights are a bit unbalanced | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/969/weights-are-a-bit-unbalanced,2729,8,2,Kardafly,"Now i have yet to buy the game, so i might be a bit off about the chest size here but I think 10000kg is too much.  My car weighs about 1500kg, that'd be 6 and a half of my cars squished into the chest.  Maybe if you were storing solid iron ingots you would hit that but.. say if you were storing meat, that is about 13 really fat cows.  Not just the usable meat you would get from 13 of them, but 13 whole entire lumbering overweight bovine. That's a big chest. I should think a volume limit would be the best thing here.  Perhaps slots, as you say, could work, but the more time consuming route of going through and assigning everything a volume and using that to determine how full a chest is would be the best way I think. And carts really ought to have both a volume and a weight limit, with the cart becoming full whenever one of them is reached. As to your first point i totally agree, that would be a mighty shovel to hold 30kg.  Maybe half that would be a better number."
bug-reports,Weights are a bit unbalanced | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/969/weights-are-a-bit-unbalanced,2729,8,3,Furbal,"Hi Kardafly, It's overall game mechanics I'm talking about here. We aren't after realism in storage because if you were we couldn't do anything with the chests that would be meaningful to the game. You aren't storing 5000 kg of anything inside a chest but for a game, you have to have someplace to store the blocks of the game. For game-play purposes I pointed out what I did in the earlier post. Meat weights 1 kg per piece and stacks in stacks of 100... that's not realism, that's game mechanics and playability. That's what the focus needs to be on some of these things. Having a chest where i can effectively use 2 of the possible dozen slots is frustrating as a player trying to produce on large quantities. The byproducts from smelting alone are all but impossible to deal with on any scale but small. AT least that's what I'm finding focusing this game on nothing but mining type technology. I can't recommend the game enough. It is incredibly fun even with the minor things that I attempt to point out for further consideration. It could be that I'm missing an important aspect of the theory behind everything and that's why the chest storage is like it is. Either way, I'd be remiss if as an Alpha player I didn't give that feedback. Please! Come join us in playing the alpha! I bet this game becomes a best seller when it's finally released. It really is well designed so far."
bug-reports,Weights are a bit unbalanced | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/969/weights-are-a-bit-unbalanced,2729,8,4,Kardafly,"Dont worry, i intend to buy the game soon.  Just waiting till i have a few extra sheckles. Now, when i play minecraft i'm a pack rat, nothing gets thrown away, and it leads to these ridiculous rooms full of chests full of stone and dirt and gravel from my excavations.  I can take out a huge cavern and store the waste material in 3 or 4 chests.  That seems to me like it could be a problem.  That dirt and stone would in real life likely be stored in a giant pile outside, which causes runoff problems when it rains, plus it looks bad too, and im sure there are other very real ecological side effects that i just dont know about.  These are issues that i think are totally relevant to a game like ECO.  If you have really high volumes of stone, dirt, or tailings i think you should have to keep them outside.  Maybe even build a barn or some similar storage containment area to cut down on pollution.  If you cant handle that, you need to scale down to a point where you can handle it, or deal with the adverse effects. Im not saying here that i want the game to aim for perfect realism, i totally agree that a chest should be able to hold more than the few hundred kg that you could realistically fit, and the players backpack for that matter, but i dont want to be able to avoid real pollution issues, a core aspect of ECO, for the sake of playability.
I want to have to build those containment areas, solve the waste disposal problems.  In real life there are entire industries dedicated to recycling and properly disposing of waste materials.  Why not in ECO too? Cant wait to join you good folks in playing!  Im thinking we will get the game for the alpha 5 update."

Needing to use vehicles to transport quantities of resources means that the roads and railways that might normally just get built for aesthetics will now have a use.  Public works infrastructure will be worth paying taxes for.  Plus it will make those really big projects a bit tougher, forcing you to plan out a resource supply chain instead of just making a few trips to haul everything in. I think both of those things would really tie into the game well."

Only animation I have notice was several times at very beginning while cutting fern. Only several times from all.

Basically don't put any tools there - in order to use a tool, it needs to be in one of the toolbar slots instead.  Only large items that are picked up, such as dirt, logs, will go in that slot and it will happen automatically.  We don't really have a tutorial so none of this is your fault, it can be very confusing at the start. for axe swinging, you need to click and hold instead of just clicking once.  With no skills, chopping a tree will take 10 hits to bring down. For harvesting plants, you need to highlight the ground underneath the plant and press 'E'.  Some plants require the scythe to harvest however.  Again with the scythe, you need to click and hold to continue the action. I don't really know about the servers you are trying to join.  It could be that the host keeps shutting down the server, taking it offline.  StrangeLoops debug server should be running continously."

bug-reports,Stuck in eternal walk mode | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/654/stuck-in-eternal-walk-mode,5677,14,14,Particleman,"Yup have this issue here as well. I have tons of devices like throttle, joystick, xboxone controller, pedels and probably a few other devices. Unplugging ALL of them doesn't seem to make a difference. I'm not excited to uninstall all the driver hardware for them just to get this fixed so... I do recommend a way to just clear out ALL key binds. This may fix the issue and not require a Unity patch. Hope there is a quick remedy to this. Thanks! Particleman"

bug-reports,Combustion Generators | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/827/combustion-generators,2594,3,2,Nappelinis,"Both Combustion generators and Electrical Generators are currently not being able to be picked up. Like some other things. From my understanding.
Combustion Generator (Fuel: Petroleum, Gasoline) produces Mechanical Energy
Electrical Generator (Fuel: Mechanical Energy) produces Electricity
If I understand the code correctly, these are range (50 blocks) based, meaning they shouldn't need to be next to each other to function.
We got the Combustion Gen to consume Gasoline, and the Electrical Generator to pick it up and produce Electricity, but not been able to power TABLES with it. Not sure if cables or something a like is needed yet. These two work in tandem with each other. I know for sure the Electrical can only be accessed by the owner, not sure if this applies to the Combustion Gen as well. We have not been able to make this work with (Kiln, CementKiln, Blast Furnace) By the looks of it, the Induction Generator will take (Petroleum and Gasoline) and produce Electricity directly. But we haven't progressed there just yet. Hope this helps on your endeavors, will keep posting if we find out more."

bug-reports,Potential digestion glitch: extremely fast digestion | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/810/potential-digestion-glitch-extremely-fast-digestion,1920,6,1,jhadred,"Has anyone else encountered a situation where they eat some foods and within a few minutes it's digested and have any details? I don't think indigestion and the runs or nausea exist as concepts, except for an admin command, however Nappelinis and I have encountered a situation where food disappeared from our systems extremely quickly. I believe it may have to do with eating the same types foods that have recently digested (in some fashion), as we both had been following some food plans of mine.  I will be seeing if I can duplicate it further. Edit:  I just had it happen within the timeframe of creating the post.  I had eaten the same 3 food types that I had previously eaten (and digested).   The scenario was that in the past two days, I was eating 3 foods that maximized my skill points to 298/day.  I don't know when it digested today since I was gone for 10 hours, but when I returned I was at 0.0 and no foods.  I figured that was normal digestion.  I then ate the same foods.  295.1   A few minutes later, 0.0.    Checked with Nappelinis to see if he had any info on his situation where muffins were disappearing from his stomach then burned calories, ate the same foods again to 295.1 and posted the pre-edit information.  I came back to find myself at 0.0 again.
I have now just eaten 1 different food type and 1 same foodtype which will give me at most 268.6 points and will reply if anything happens to that same foodtype. Edit 2:  I just realized that Nappelinis had started one of my food plans prior to me making more of them and I also accidentally ate different seeds twice which may have extended my digestion time somehow, since I believe he said his occurred on day two, and I had been on my food plan for about 3 days.  I have not had a strange digestion disappearance in the past hour and will monitor as much as possible (limited timeframe for me in the next day or two) .  If I can duplicate, then I will have to recommend not eating the full same food types that just digested, but instead, include another item just for the sake of resetting a digestion timer that would remove the entire stack of food. Note:  It looks like digestion somehow acts as a stack instead of a per item 'first in, first out' method. Edit 3:  briefly logged in again within 30 minutes.  The foodtype did disappear.  The new foodtype did not.   (ate a different new foodtype to get some amount of points and will let these digest to be able to retest starting with a desired food plan."
bug-reports,Potential digestion glitch: extremely fast digestion | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/810/potential-digestion-glitch-extremely-fast-digestion,1920,6,2,jhadred,"A thought comes up which the developers could better test . Would they get this behavior eating only ecoylent?  As this would mean the ""player"" is eating only one food type and this could cause the same behavior if eaten often enough.  Say eating one before the previous would be digested. Could it be that the digestion timer is active separately for each item, and when each timer ends, it clears out the stack of foods so that additionally eaten items are cleared out by those prior timers?  So if we were to eat 9 muffins and 9 sausages both eaten in rapid succession due to calorie use (mining).  The full stack of muffins disappear due to the first eaten muffin leaving 9 sausages and making food imbalance make skill points per day take a nosedive.  Therefore 9 more muffins are eaten to bring it back up.  These disappear in a few minutes due to timer #2 clearing the stack?  So in annoyance 9 more muffins are eaten.  They then disappear due to timer #3.  Etc. If that's the case a workaround would be to let the last timer elapse before eating the same foodstuff.  I'll work on eating the same thing to see if the above could be true."
bug-reports,Potential digestion glitch: extremely fast digestion | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/810/potential-digestion-glitch-extremely-fast-digestion,1920,6,3,jhadred,"Some of my food is still disappearing soon after I eat it so I haven't been able to start a fresh test yet.  If someone is at the point that they're willing, can someone try to reproduce it?  You'll be getting 250 skill points per day in return until the issue starts.  Here are two ratios, one using a skill of cooking 4, another using a skill of cooking 2.: Start with an empty stomach if possible.  Perhaps if you are feeding a teammate and they haven't eaten yet:
*Eat nothing but campfire stew and wheat porridge in a 2:1 ratio .  So 2 stew : 1 porridge
This will give 2850 calories, and also give you average nutrients of C: 33.2, P: 29.5, F: 36.8, V: 37.4 with a multiplier of 1.8 and daily skill points of 250.5
*Do labor so you have to eat a lot.  Eat only these foods. Ideally, on day 1, you'll have anywhere from 10:5 to 20:10 in the stomach itself.  On day 2, you might have the 20:10 or more.
*On day 2 and 3 or longer: monitor your stomach to see how the food disappears.  a) Does an entire stack just disappear even though you only ate example: 3 hours ago?  b) Keep eating the same thing.  Does this disappear quickly?  Once you can confirm this is happening, please reply.  Also, you'll need to switch to eating anything other than the foods that are disappearing (stew/porridge). Don't have cooking 4 and never will?  You can still help and get a 178.5 skill point rate.
*Eat a 1:1 charred meat to charred greens ratio.  This will give you 24, 24, 28, 24 with a multiplier of 1.8 and as mentioned 178.5 daily skill point.
Follow same instructions as the Cooking 4 ratio."

While a test seed that was planted (6hr growtime) had grown, all of the prior seeds have not yet grown.  These include:  Trees, bunchgrass, ferns and the rest of the regular crops.
Bunchgrass should take 1 hour at 0%, and mine is at 50, so a bunchgrass test last night (after 9pm est) grew.  However, the bunchgrass planted between Tuesday and Last night had not grown at all.  After some thinking last night, I would have expected these to grow even if the grow timer was reset with every crash since it only should take an hour. If this was fixed, then I think because that the cannot be dug up or buried or options are to abandon the fields and try again elsewhere, or restart the server (only on the assumption that all of your other ecology has nosedived).

The server I'm on hasn't crashed for over 6 hours, (and I want to say even longer) but none of the other seeds have done anything. (particularly trees, ferns and bunchgrass).

bug-reports,4.2 missing wall bug? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/779/4-2-missing-wall-bug,1388,8,3,stormoffires,There is an invisible object  that is preventing placing of any object in its place.  It took us a min to figure out that because an opening had appeared by a door or exceeded the max openings for a room thats why tables went down but now we can not fill this holes and have had to work around them. we had 3 other buildings with issues but after some tricky play with tables it allowed us to fill the holes. one spot we have a tree growing.. very weird bugs with the 4.2 update.  all of these spots had wall pieces before the update and the server has had several restarts since update.

Ok so unfortunately I can't post a picture of this happening..... but I had planted huckleberries on my tilled ground. When it was time for their harvest i used E to harvest them and gathered them just fine.(side note you have to hit E multiple times on a planted bush its not a 1 click thing so you get alot more berries than expected!)   Afterwards I planted wheat seeds on that ground.  Now whenever i go to harvest that wheat with my scythe/sickle I always receive wheat AND huckleberries.

I had an above ground case were a cart stuck on terrain vanished and then at some later point reappeared.  I think this happens to several carts in the world simultaneously; I recall other people all started talking about missing carts on the server at the same time.  No other correlations I can think of.

After a server crash/restart they were back (along with everyone elses missing carts).  By this stage i had built a new powered cart which i was happily using however at some point the one parked outside the tunnel was in my way so i moved it slightly.  A few hours later my new cart and the moved cart remained while the one which i had left stationary again had disappeared, fallen through the world and buried at -27000 or something close to."

The player would only need to us ""W"" or ""S"" to drive it forward or backward, and it would follow the road, on ""rails"" so to speak.
And if you have intersections one could just use the ""A"" and ""D"" keys to choose which direction.

I play on the Dev server and noticed this after the server shut down briefly and restarted itself.

Replaced with 2 candles! | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/674/chest-design-gone-missing-replaced-with-2-candles,12677,32,9,Mysteria,So question once the dev server restarts ( i assume today since it's day 7 and meteor is huge) will I be able to craft them again? Or is this still unknown.  And what brought up the bug the only thing that I know is if you are online when the server goes down and you log in it has an odd habit of multiplying designs in the workbench. Oh and minor note sawmills still wont even open up a gui but I think I saw that you all were already aware of this.

Once placed, it unlocks recipes in the crafting table rather than functioning on its own. This is not clearly represented - in fact it only roughly states it in the tooltip - and we're looking into clarifying it. Server wipes will definitely fix the crafting issue. A restart, however, is unknown. The issue is likely with serialization so it may not actually fix the issue depending on where the problem is present."

In addition, you can actually stop the bug from happening entirely if you only have a single one of each table present in any given world - not that that's feasible - but its possible that reducing the number of redundant tables of the same type will help this bug happen less."

Win64 Detailed Description of Issue:
When mining placed Hammer and Axe in chest. Only Pick and Shovel in inventory. Finished Kiln, placed Kiln in room. Kiln = 3rd item in the room, making the room invalid. Unable to open chest within invalid room to retrieve hammer/axe to fix either room(axe) or remove 3rd item from room (hammer). Items can be retrieved from chest with left mouse click. Retrieved Stone/Tallow Candles, unable to left click retrieve axe or hammer from said chest. Reproducible? How difficult is it to reproduce?
Super easy if you follow those above steps. Steps to reproduce bug/issue:
Follow steps above. Additional Comments:
Only solution to fix the issue, use pick and shovel to make valid room somehow (if possible).

bug-reports,Player camera offset after cart usage | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/666/player-camera-offset-after-cart-usage,1316,4,1,urb4n0ninj4,"Not sure if client or server side.
OS; Windows 10 Description of Issue: When entering and exiting cart the player camera seems to offset forward or backward. That is to say that when not operating a cart, after using it, one can turn left or right and the center of rotation appears to be in front of or behind you (where as it is normally centered in the player). This is hard to describe in text or still picture, if it is not clear I can try to provide more info. This should be reproducible, but I've seen no one mention the issue. To my knowledge all that need be done to reproduce it is use the wooden cart. Operate it, move it a bit, and exit. Repeat, and the issue sometimes compounds to make the amount the character is offset even greater. Additional Comments: The issue is resolved by disconnecting and reconnecting. The problem can also be noticed as hitting walls too soon (or late, depending on offset direction) while walking toward them.

It works better than the linux version.
The terrain rendering and most of the texture are ok(not perfect) and it is playable.
The only visible bug is the bush that are pink and not well localized. A little screen shot: I don't know if there is a similar soft  on mac os but it could be a playable workaround before this bug was fixed.

bug-reports,Textures! | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/127/textures,30099,49,30,capnslipp,"@NoBlackThunder It seems more likely to me that it's an issue with Unity shaders that aren't fully OpenGL (GLSL) compatible.  The platforms that are failing are using OpenGL, whereas Windows builds (even on the same hardware, as others have found) use DirectX by default. To further diagnose this problem, it may help to make an OpenGL-only build and test that on Windows (Google it; there's some executable flags that'll do it).  Though the Intel GPUs may be part of the problem (fewer GL extensions?), so you might need to buy/borrow hardware. Also, unless I'm mistaken, the BRDF shaders you've added recently are all working across all hardware/platforms.  It's possible that Unity Tech encountered these issues and decided to only fix them for the newest shaders (countless similar decisions to take the half-assed course of action have come out of UT before).  If this is the case, and if you were already planning to update all the materials to BRDF, then that's that."

bug-reports,Textures! | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/127/textures,30099,49,32,capnslipp,"@NoBlackThunder Honestly, it might make the most sense just to write all your custom shaders specifically in GLSL.  You're making a cross-platform game— so use the defacto standard cross platform graphics library. DirectX is Microsoft's proprietory graphics library.  The case could be made for using it if you were using volumetric effects or compute shaders or other modern AAA-quality effects, and if you were fine with giving a distinctly poorer experience to OS X and Linux users.  I believe the goals of your game or ecosystem simulation and a relatively short timeline with a small team over flashy photo-realistic effects, so making any part of the game work better on DirectX makes about as much sense as starting work on a Metal version of every shader for OS X and PSSL for PS4. Summary: Get it working first & foremost.  Us OS X & Linux users are backers too, and so far we've received perceptively nothing."

Graphics card drivers are a different story because they're assembled and shipped by Apple in its own computers.  Apple has end-to-end control on graphics cards, and while they lag behind new standards (e.g. OpenGL 4), they're usually on it with issue fixes. …Because if they aren't on it, it gets very expensive for them to do free-under-warranty replacements/upgrades at Apple Stores.  And it's not terribly difficult for a customer to prove that there's a “problem” with a specific computer by clean-installing the latest OS, showing the graphics card is “misbehaving”, and showing that both their older Macs and newer Macs run the game without issues."

bug-reports,Unable to log in | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/613/unable-to-log-in,10279,29,1,Hed9870,I had started my own server just to check out some of the new features and get used to it before I joined a larger community. After accomplishing a few simple tasks I was suddenly logged out and got a message that I was logged in elsewhere. I have been unable to log back in to the game with or without my server running. I am also unable to log in to my account through Strangeloopgames.com. Any help or advice would be appreciated.

bug-reports,Impact Bug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/544/impact-bug,2086,3,1,Elliander,"I have been running a server 24/7 even when not logged in to play, and had the disaster set as follows:  So, realistically, the comet should be gone. However, I noticed it soaring around regardless every game. Pretty large, though not very clear. Well, for the first time I experienced an ""impact"" of sorts - or rather, the comet seemed to fly... through me. It was weird.  I'm not really sure how to repeat this, but it's on day 337, early morning. I was on a point of high elevation under where the comet usually flies by. I saved a back up of the world right after, and then when I went back in  (changed tab, not logged out then back in) I found this:  It clearly hit along a degrading orbit and dragged a line through the world making the ocean look weird.  but that quickly disappears and then there is just another crater. Lots of craters actually. If I dig two blocks down from one this is what I see:  Hopping down I fall through that brown spot into an under chasm:  It looks like all those craters are just layered over the sandy landscape:  I eventually found what was left of my house:  From there I was able to locate the whole in the ground where I put my underground base beneath the ocean. Apparently, there was still some ocean left.  aha! lol! So building deep under ground protects the base from being destroyed in the calamity!  So, downside: The server settings to prevent an impact doesn't work. Eventually it impacts anyway.
Upside: The mechanisms are in place that if it was possible to heal the land (currently, it's not, and I can't till the soil up there) people could build and store goods underground and the entire building will remain perfectly intact so they can stock pile seeds, resources, etc. (maybe even animals and trees with artificial lighting?) and it will work. Not sure how much of this was known, but nothing was happening as expected so I just took a bunch of screenshots as I went through. So... this world is dead, but I have enough raw materials in my store house to rebuild as a mole man :P until I run out of food that is. Note: Every deed was stored in the storehouse under ground, so if the game was supposed to delete the object on the surface it's possible that the deeds being intact had something to do with it. It's obvious that the impact works by replacing objects with a pattern of blocks so having objects below that overwrite pattern may have thrown things off. EDIT: So it looks like I can pick up the doors no problem, but I can't remove the building, even though it has no parts. I also can't actually build anything where a building is/was on the surface. Would have been nice to recover materials, but oh well. "
bug-reports,Impact Bug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/544/impact-bug,2086,3,2,Elliander,"My high elevation sky bridge is gone (a shame, I put so much work into that, but reinforces the idea that it deletes top down) but lo and behold, near where that bridge should be, a tree!  and more trees! and a living deer!  and my lumber mill, that I made out of dirt blocks along with the minimum wood, is actually still fully intact!  I was not expecting to see intact surface features, let alone life! Venturing further from the site of impact I find more trees, bits of grass even:  crops are dead (can be cut, but nothing harvests), but other animals are alive:  I think, in the final release, this is what should be seen more of. An almost dead world that CAN be saved, and with only a few craters at the impact site. It looks like I can add some more dirt to the areas that have green, and I was able to plant the last of my seed (a shame the impact couldn't wait until AFTER I was done harvesting) If farming allowed you to get back more seed than you put in I might be able to impact the ecology of the dead world, but I will eventually run out unless I find more. Living rabbits too!  I saw a bird as well fluttering to dead berry plants, not sure what's up with that. Can't seem to harvest bunch grass seed after impact. This block is blinking green:  ****** At this point my computer crashed! It's an overclocked 6 core 3.3 GHz Intel i7 to 4.5 GHz with water cooling. It went through extensive testing, and there was only one core that could have overheated, but only if it was fully stressed for a VERY long time, so it seems that this game pushed my CPU to it's limits. Either that or something about this post apocalyptic world crashes the computer. I was relieved that chrome saved everything I wrote ******"

bug-reports,Cooked Meat Indebie; Raw Meat Edible | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/541/cooked-meat-indebie-raw-meat-edible,2210,4,1,Elliander,"Hi, I have cooked a piece of meat, but when I try to eat it the game tells me it is inedible. When I right click on raw meat I can eat it no problem.  I thought maybe cooking skill was related, like there was bad meals cooked, so crafted the skill book and got the cooking skill to level 2, and crafted more cooked meat, but it made no difference. Kinda strange that meat is only edible raw, seems like a bug. Should be the other way around. Hovering over raw meat shows it's nutrients.  I'm guessing this is something as simple as the wrong function calling the wrong object. A typo. I'm surprised, but after searching the forums I don't see this otherwise reported or listed as known."

Client/Server communication OS/Web Browser?

It's particularly bad when hunting after firing the first shot, making it hard to land the kill shot.  This should be fixable by allowing the client to predict/interpolate motion and position between updates from the server.  They seem to also be able to move in the y direction infinitely fast.

bug-reports,Animal movement is extremely jerky | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/257/animal-movement-is-extremely-jerky,2555,6,5,Xelotath,"Oh man I hope it's not an issue with AI or pathing.  Hopefully it's just a matter of the client waiting until receiving the new data from the server to update position.  That's a lot smaller of an issue because the client knows position at t=0 and t=1 ticks, so at t=1.5 the position should be approximately 50% farther.  (Sorry, I said interpolation but it's actually extrapolation.) It won't be exact doing it that way, and maybe a little rubberbandy, but better than it is now."

It just gets deleted. I closed and reopened the game just to be sure.  I thought this might have something to do with ocean level itself, but no, when I found dirt colored blocks they had no trouble being dug and added to inventory - but the sand there also deleted.

So far thats still the case in alpha 4, but we can look into making it more apparent that you can't go deeper."
bug-reports,Sand deletes when dug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/533/sand-deletes-when-dug,2885,7,5,Elliander,"I thought it might be the limits of the world, but it's not at a uniform depth. Dirt blocks can go way below and beyond these blocks in many places I have seen. On one island this unbreakable block was just a few layers under the surface near the top of where I put my basement and the same elevation of the stone block that could be broken. Since the animation goes on just the same, and expends energy trying, there's no kind of indication of if a block is unbreakable and no apparent pattern to where these are. The block mechanics are clearly similar to Minecraft, where they use ""Bedrock"" as the unbreakable. At a set elevation all blocks are bedrock, and there might be random bedrock one space above that, but otherwise you won't find bedrock too high up. Obviously, you have a spherical world, and when I build a bridge I can see the spherical bend from a distance which is much better than the Minecraft engine, but close up there is no bend so it's obvious that you still have an unfolded XYZ coordinate system that just get folded into a sphere so it shouldn't be too difficult to set a bedrock layer. Personally, I like underground building, so the most depth that could be added the better. Other players will likely want to push into the limits of the sky. There's going to be some coherent point players can expect to go down and the map should work in layers. I mean, if I build a house at one elevation, there's no reason why a player 20 blocks below can't build a house right under. Maybe one world will want to set up an underground road system that has public use rights, while still allowing players to use the surface of the world. An idea on that though: What if you set up that ""unbreakable"" block to actually be ""breakable"" with a high enough skill level, to build geothermal energy - or, alternatively, a doomsday weapon?"
bug-reports,Sand deletes when dug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/533/sand-deletes-when-dug,2885,7,6,Metachronism,"Yeah, its at a variable depth at different points in the world.  To be specific, the 'top soil' depth (or diggable/mineable depth) is a max of 25% of the world generation size.  This is mostly done as a memory optimization on the server. So for example if the max world height is set to 100, the max depth anywhere from the surface would be 25 blocks.  This is just the way it works now, it will probably change multiple times or be set as a configurable option. One of the ideas we have floated is having support to dig through the world and come out the other side.  How we would handle gravity in the middle (or the whole surviving the magma thing), I don't know - but its an interesting idea that may happen some day."
bug-reports,Sand deletes when dug | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/533/sand-deletes-when-dug,2885,7,7,Elliander,"Digging through to the other side would be interesting, but would definitely require property lines to overlap. I think a better solution would be for there to be a molten core,  with perhaps a kind of semi-unbreakable block at varying depths that requires extra special tools to remove, and then a final block at the absolute depth which can't be broken through, but can have a geothermal device attached to it in pieces or can have a doomsday weapon built to crack the core. Maybe you could also build a specialized tube through the core to create an elevator. Maybe a future space elevator could even tie directly into that, connecting underground cities to surface cities to space colonies. or... you could go with the expanding Earth theory of geology. I actually have an old geology book that is well over a hundred years old. It was written before plate tectonics as an idea was accepted. According to the expanding Earth theory, the world is hollow, but inflates in size due to meteorite collisions constantly adding mass. In some versions there is a tiny Sun at the center and volcanoes are just heat vents. It's an interesting model to say the least. Gravity is actually explained pretty simple in that model, using equations that are still valid in physics. Basically, the attraction you feel to the Earth is gravity minus centripetal force. This is absolutely true, and the closer you are to the core the weaker gravity is to you. This is why there is a region of Canada where the gravity is actually lower than the rest of the world. Anyway, the model asserts - wrongly - that there is a point in the Earth where the centripetal force overcomes gravity, so when you get to this point it's more difficult to approach - gravity gets lighter as you approach the line - and then you flip around and start clinging to the ceiling. If you went with that model, you would have an entire inner world with it's own systems. It wouldn't be a factual representation of the real world, but it does represent old ideas people held and it's certainly more interesting than just ending up on the other side."

bug-reports,Bottomless Pits? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/531/bottomless-pits,710,1,1,Elliander,"Um... is this game supposed to have bottomless pits? With trees growing over emptiness? and rivers disappearing abruptly? I'm afraid to go in because I can't see the bottom.  In case this is a bug someone wants to look at, I did a save-as of the server at this point. Then I placed a single block on the side of a block inside it and land was suddenly generated around it up to a point. There was a smaller ledge that I could jump into, which was filled in when I placed the single block, so that's scary, but when I cut a tree nearby to drop in the rest of the chasm filled and the river connected.  What's really scary about this is if a player can fall in and tries to get out by filling in blocks. It would be so much worse than getting stuck between blocks while building a house, and the game doesn't seem to let you dig while stuck, so it would literally be a game ending bug for a player unless some button to ""unstuck"" a player by shifting them to the nearest unoccupied space is possible."

bug-reports,[Server Bug]  An item with the same key has already been added. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/457/server-bug-an-item-with-the-same-key-has-already-been-added,1608,3,1,TheBorg,"http://pastebin.com/4nzHkCYM Description of the issue: The issue can occur at any moment, however you will not be known of its existence until your server crashes or you attempt to reboot. It will stop your server starting. This means that there is a significant chance that all of backups either generated by yourself or the server are inherently bugged. (I've had backups up to 12 hours prior be useless, initially)OS: Windows server 2012 R2 Further research and half-assed solution:
The error itself can be found in several users in your server, it seems one user is not capable of having ""Same key"" issues. This means that at least two users in your server are causing this bug. I have not gone as far as figuring out what that specific key is, due to my sanity not allowing it. Open the ""Users.eco"" file with Winrar (probably 7Zip)  and essentially you will have to start culling the population until the server no longer throws the error.  From there you add users back and attempt to mark who or what creates a new issue.Red marked names are hold the faulty key After this I mix and matched to see if any of these faulty key users could be in the server together. (Who knows, maybe there are several different duplicate keys) So you spend time testing that too.Nope.. Every user shared the same Duplicate key error or even worse multiple faults At this point you can delete all the faulty users or keep 1 faulty user standing (you will have to delete next server restart though, don't know why, but its a thing). Your server will run fine again, the deleted players will however all have lost their inventory.. And deeds unless they were put in a chest. I've been forced to wipe the server several times at dismay of the players. It is inherently impossible to actually run  a semi populated server due to this issue. It's crazy... Final note is that obviously due to the nature of the bug, you will likely end up doing this EVERY SINGLE TIME reboots or crashes. Have fun! One last edit, obviously.. I cannot recommend deleting player files, as I have no clue how they are linked with for example world objects. So you might just create bigger issues down the road, I for myself really wanted to keep this world going so this is the path i took. List of fun things that break"

bug-reports,[Client] Tree Stumps (Can We Keep This Bug? <3) | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/453/client-tree-stumps-can-we-keep-this-bug-3,1111,3,1,anna,"This was a client-side bug that I would love to keep but I think it's not supposed to be here. You can remove tree stumps by placing a block on top of them, and then removing that block. It's easily reproducible. Just find a tree stump anywhere, and place a block of dirt on it, then shovel the dirt. The stump will be gone. Sometimes the stump comes back, which is annoying but you just have to replace it with a block again. There's a stump in the wall of my Hunter's Lodge, and I had to keep reopening it to remove the stump and place back the wall. Recently, I tried just placing a wall on top of it (instead of removing first) and it hasn't come back. So that's a plus! Also I'd just like to point out that you gain skill and lose calories while you're offline. The calories part is bad (I joined a server once for like a second, and the next week when I went on, I was starving), but the skill is nice! Except it makes it too easy to gain skills. I'm using the current version of Eco."

There are multiple related issues here, I think. Firstly, if you build a line of Road blocks (in either horizontal direction), they render as stone/dirt bumps instead of a smooth road.  This can sort-of be solved by putting a two-wide row of Road blocks, but there are still holes along the middle.  Also, if you try and put Road blocks beside other solid blocks, (ie. in the join in the above screenshot) It will render as a big square cube block, if it's next to an object like dirt, stone or lumber. If you put it beside something like a Camas plant or a Tree, it will render like that block contains a path tile (as if it's trying to join on to it)."

Arch Linux 64 bit
Pentium Dual Core E5300 (I know)
6Gb ram I assumed it was a swap issue so I turned off swap, tried reducing as well as increasing it, but didn't affect it. This persists across the recent 0.2 release. I think the game runs fine (it's smooth) until (I'm assuming) it runs out of ram at which point it starts swapping hard and the system freezes. Only 1 time did it ever return to normal after about 3 minutes but normally it won't even after 30 minutes. I guess you could blame my outdated CPU but I'm guessing that modern computers get lag spikes as well. If you can fix it great but if you can't I guess I'll just have to get a new computer"

Apparently, if you are in the process of constructing a building and while placing the initial markers down (not the 1st, but the 2nd corner) and you swap to a tool and break a block (possibly has to be in the construction spot), the building cancels but not correctly. This results in no one else on the server or yourself being able to build a structure. Effectively, an active construction project begins for everyone that no one can actually finish. Restarting a server will resolve this issue. @NoBlackThunder"

I started to clear all brush away before placing the markers and I've had no problems since.

bug-reports,[Bug] Removing/Replacing block breaks the world | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/397/bug-removing-replacing-block-breaks-the-world,1135,2,1,Zenita,"From friend who caused this:
So ... short hand of what I was doing - I had built a stone container for tailings, but wanted to make it deeper, so dug out a big cube of space under the stone floor. Once I had it dug out I started to line it with stone, when I had filled 2 and a half of the walls + the floor, it all vanished. But hammering one of the invisible stone pieces brings it back. You can now make it disappear by putting a new stone piece down in the area. I confirm replace/removing the stone breaks/fixes the area. Visible for all players and occurred even after server restart. So enjoy this video!http://plays.tv/video/56656659080879fada EDIT: ""Basically if you start laying stone in the area seems to trigger it, definitely if lining the walls
Checked putting more stone on the floor - does it too. Seems that if you remove 2 stone, you can put 2 in elsewhere - and the 3rd one breaks it"""

the bug is on high priority and has the comment ""possible resolved"". So i think chances are good it is resolved in the next release.
Until then, did you tried installing another Desktop? If running an Ubuntu-System you may try installing xfce (sudo apt-get install xfce4 ).
You then can choose your desktop environment in the login screen of your system (after completely logging out from the current session). how to get around the bug with xfce is described above ;)"

Whenever I try to start it up it crashes.
Maybe it's a similar issue, maybe something else, so I thought, best to let you know.
It seems to crash on the Creating World part, or at least that's the last thing I see it doing when it crashes. The problem started when we restarted the server because blocks that we were breaking/placing weren't (dis)appearing.
By logging out and back in, we could see the placed/removed blocks, but again didn't see a change when we tried to break/place new ones. Our inventory did get updated though. In the hopes of fixing the problem, we did a server restart and got this result. --BEGIN DUMP--

Can't reproduce this problem.
If you still having this issue, please let us know(or tag me and just reply.)
And recent change we made was that you can only pick up door with your deed. so from server crash if everything wiped out, you can't just pick door up.
Next thing we gonna do is also clearing world object on several crash(which causing world to regen)"
bug-reports,[Client bug]Food freshness incorrect | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/206/client-bug-food-freshness-incorrect,2295,9,1,Ryve,"Server, Client or Website? Client OS/Web Browser? Windows 7 Detailed Description of Issue:
Food loses freshness overtime.
To show the bug I will be using meat as an example.
When I kill an elk I get 5 raw meat. I cannot see it's freshness since I have the butchery skill and it is inedible.
When I cook it or I turn into prepared meat the freshness is not determined by how long I had the raw meat.
It's like the server was ticking down freshness of all the food from the start and when you get that food, it will have the freshness that the server says it should be at.
To make it clearer: I killed an elk and prepared the meat. It's freshness was at 70%. Later I killed another elk to get more meat.
The cooked meat I already had was at 67%. The new meat that I cooked instantly also had 67%.
I tried this again later. My meat was at 64%, but this time I ate it all before cooking the raw meat. The cooked meat still came out at 64% though.
I hope this is clear. If not, please say so. Reproducible? How difficult is it to reproduce?
Every time I cooked or prepared meat it's freshness was determined like described above. Steps to reproduce bug/issue:
Just get some food. Additional Comments: - Client Version? 0.1.5805.31407"

It may be a minor bug in itself that the interface gave no initial indication of this issue (the construction window progressed from showing my progress towards area enclosed to showing the full details of height, volume, etc. once I'd laid out the foundation in unrefined stone, just as if I'd been using the right material), but perhaps more significant was that once I corrected this issue by replacing the foundation with refined stone, it still wouldn't let me complete the construction. I eventually canceled the construction and started a new one with the same corners at the original site, and it then instantly recognized the building as a complete mill and let me complete the construction right away; so there was nothing wrong with the building, just with the game's recognition of its completion. So, in short, it seems that if a building is started with a foundation of the wrong material, the game is unable to recognize if you later correct the issue, rendering the construction impossible to complete unless you cancel it and start a new one. I haven't tried to replicate this, admittedly."

Not really sure why it got deleted, there was no error messages in console as far as I could see, so I guess it just got corrupted and regenerated the world. Is there anyway to recover the world or am I just stuck with a new one? Thanks,
Killerjerick P.S. The reason I exit the server is because of the meteor, when I first started the world I hadn't realised you can delete game objects to get rid of it, so I can't wait until next patch so I can turn it off until I want a little bit of challenge."

I had made a backup of my world too little too late (it was after the corruption but before restarting the server).  When I copied the backups back into Storage, I copied 1 file at a time, restarting the server and logging in between each.  I now have the buildings and world as they were, but my character is reset and many of the buildings are missing crafting tables. The first time I started the server after copying in the ""users.eco"" file, there were 2 errors that said ""Index was outside the bounds of the array"" (my server also happens to have 2 players).  After copying the ""worldobjects.eco"" file and every time thereafter, it gives many errors as shown in the screenshot."

Entering another building resets it, though, overriding the message with that building's title, which then goes back to properly showing the GPS coordinates once you leave it. I suppose the issue is that the ""Abandon construction"" command fails to send the same signal to that position box that exiting a building's perimeter would, and once the construction is abandoned there's no perimeter to exit to send it that signal."

I left my private server running while I was out with the family for thanksgiving.  I came back to see the following stats in the ECO Sim.     As you can see there has been a slight decline in Huckleberry since the half day mark.  However, there was a brief spike of animal population at the 1.2 mark followed by a significant drop in animal population.  I'm going to keep this going to see if the population can rebuild.  I logged on expecting to see a lot of dead bodies but I don't see many.

bug-reports,Sudden Population Drop | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/254/sudden-population-drop,4882,14,5,Hilnus,I did just notice the population didn't drop at all for the first day although I know I saw some die and even hunted a few elk and wolves myself.  It could be the population graphs catching up to what had actually dropped off?
bug-reports,Sudden Population Drop | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/254/sudden-population-drop,4882,14,6,NoBlackThunder,i think it might be a massive death suddenly :S maybe they die of old age?
bug-reports,Sudden Population Drop | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/254/sudden-population-drop,4882,14,7,Hilnus,"Death by old age counter in the law page shows 0 for Wolves,  95 for Hares,  126 for Elk.  So it could be that as well."
bug-reports,Sudden Population Drop | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/254/sudden-population-drop,4882,14,8,Hilnus,Coming up to the end of day 2.  I checked the population levels and the deaths by old age and starvation and here is what I see.  I know this is a balance issue but I still find it all fascinating.  As you can see starvation deaths are well above old age rates.  In the second screen shot you can see that plant life has not dropped much at all.  So basically nothing is eating?
bug-reports,Sudden Population Drop | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/254/sudden-population-drop,4882,14,9,Sepian,"When I was poking around in the Stats tab noticed that nothing is currently 'Edible' nor does it seem to mature running the sim.

bug-reports,Sudden Population Drop | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/254/sudden-population-drop,4882,14,12,doqunbop,"I think the population graph does include the dead bodies, because I've had the same problem, a lot of dead bodies laying around and then suddenly the next day a big population loss spike for all animals. I also had the same problem with animals running in one spot, not being able to move, even when shot at - probably the reason for not being able to reach the food sources. I haven't noticed any animal reproduction yet either."

I was using my numbers on my keyboard to switch to my hammer. Now it happened fast so I'm not 100% sure, but this is what I think happened.
I chose the wrong number, namely the one my pickax was in.
If you start clicking too soon after you switch you won't actually start swinging, which I did.

I think I stumbled across them because I chose 0,0 as a natural center for my home base. First, it seems to be impossible to build a building across this border; the build screen claims that even a properly-built building is ""not enclosed"" (claiming so under ""enclosure"", ""height"", and ""volume enclosed""). Presumably, this is because the game is using those position coordinates to determine aspects of the building, and is getting confused by the wrap-around. I've tried this twice and was unable to build the building either time. Second, it's impossible to use a campfire located on the opposite side of the wrap-around border from where you're standing; the crafting menu starts to open and then immediately closes. Presumably this is because the game thinks you're standing far away, or something. I haven't tested it, but I suspect a similar issue would apply to opening doors or possibly even harvesting lumber, as well as to any other crafting table (impossible to test that last possibility until the first issue is fixed). s"

When creating a building it has to be enclosed.
If a door opening has a a block outside of it(on the foundation level), outside of the building area it will not count as enclosed.
First you have to remove the block outside the opening and then place any block inside to make the build area update.

Notice how it is on the foundation level. If it was higher then that, it would not cause the bug. Reproducible? How difficult is it to reproduce?

bug-reports,[Client bug?] BSOD | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/285/client-bug-bsod,1504,4,1,Blake,"First off, im posting this on the behalf of someone else who has lost interest in the game after multiple BSOD's. That being said I dont have ALL the information but it's something. A user on my site reported getting the ""CLOCK_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT"" BSOD error while playing, and only playing Eco. There was no error log of any type. Link to original report. ""ECO is causing this BSOD for me almost every 1-2 hours now. Well, my CPU is badly OC'ed Phenom 2 x6 1100 Stock is 3.3 i pushed it up to 4.4 but it works with all the games and benchmark programs I know and used. So I think that's related to ECO. I went back to stock clock to see if it's cause by my OC settings. Anyway... ECO is hurting my hardware and there is a cut for me. I make a few tests if it works and if not I will not touch it again until something happened with that piece of software :/"""
bug-reports,[Client bug?] BSOD | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/285/client-bug-bsod,1504,4,2,NoBlackThunder,ok .. i would suspect that something with your hardware or operation system might be wrong .. the reason why  Eco is triggering this is because the client is not optimized yet .. and actually uses your cpu full out all the time.. for now i doubt that eco is the issue =( i am sorry but i need to be honest with you .. though .. when the client gets more optimized the error could disappear as long as you computer just does not like high cpu usage

bug-reports,[Client bug?] BSOD | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/285/client-bug-bsod,1504,4,4,NoBlackThunder,really doubt the main reason is because of eco =P so people having that issue might have issues with there hardware .. maybe some low voltages ? who knows =P

bug-reports,Doors | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/196/doors,1620,5,3,hipersniper,Happened a few times. I narrowed it down to two options. Either the door dissapeared because there was a bush on the same tile as where I was placing the door. Or its because i had not put 2 block high walls on either side of the door to have something to hinge on.

I just added a comment to a law I proposed to myself on my private server. The time stamp shows 17 hr 55 min ago (it was more like 10 minutes ago).

If you finish your building (e.g. your building hut) and want to add a roof later, you are only allowed to add new blocks inside or above the designated building area. Each border field (inside) is not buildable, you rather receive an error that you are not allowed to do this. This occurs wether you are the owner or have the rights assigned by the owner using the deed. It's easily reproducible. Simply finish a building and try to add something on top of it in the border area. Client version: First Alpha, don't know which version this is."

I've made a couple of Unity games before and sometimes the exact same thing happens while debugging them. I traced the issue to my Logitech G510. Even without touching any of the ""special"" keys on it, it still sends commands to the Logitech Gaming Software to keep up to date, this for whatever reason, caused Unity to behave oddly to input. This might be a problem in Unity itself and possibly not just Eco. Anyway, you might have a software or a driver that interferes with the Unity Engine causing it to behave like this."

Btw. can trees reforest themselves? or does the player need to do something? someone mentioned to let stand 1 or 2 trees so that new ones can grow. --> is this even possible?"

I'm attempting to set up a server, but I'm having some issues when first launching it. The crash dump will be in a separate post below. Server info:
Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1
AMD FX-6300 (hexacore, 3.5 GHz)
16 Gb DDR3 RAM When I launch the server, I get a few initial lines and then I crash. Any advice you all can provide would be greatly appreciated! :D"
