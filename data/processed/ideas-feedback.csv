ideas-feedback,Limitations on closing/restarting worlds | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5126/limitations-on-closing-restarting-worlds,423,12,1,Lucien,"I have bought and played the game for 4 days. I really enjoy the idea and the overall gameplay so far. However, the constant closing/restarting of different worlds opened to the public over these days disturbs me a lot. People do cooperate in the worlds. I get along quite well with the other strangers to build up the community and technology bit by bit. However, after taking a good night's sleep, BOOM, the world was closed without any obvious reasons or previous notifications from the admin the next morning. In one particular world I played 2 days ago, I discovered that it was restarted by the admin one day and when I asked him the reason behind, all I got is ""lacking certain animals in the previous landscape"". Efforts and contributions from all players in the server should be well respected. They just shouldn't be wiped out all in a sudden because of the decision of a single person. Some preliminary thoughts on this issue:"
ideas-feedback,Limitations on closing/restarting worlds | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5126/limitations-on-closing-restarting-worlds,423,12,2,Wooster,"You do understand that (set-up dependent) a server is entirely under the control of its admin, don't you? As in, they could literally pull the electric plug out of the socket whenever they wanted. So if you want a stable world, you have two options. If an admin behaves in ways you don't like, don't go back there. Tell people on the forums you don't like the way the admin operates."
ideas-feedback,Limitations on closing/restarting worlds | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5126/limitations-on-closing-restarting-worlds,423,12,3,Nymea,"To follow on from the other reply ... I am not sure if you understand that servers are hosted by an admin ... who has to pay for the hosting. It can be quite expensive month after month for a good server with excellent up-time and enough stability to maintain multiple players in world at the same time. Down time is not always under the admin's control either since hosting companies do have periodic downtime. If the admin hosts the server from his home then he still doesn't have full control since power and communication issues happen to the best of homes at times. So while I agree that if someone does decide to offer a public server they should be willing and able to maintain it for the player base, they are ultimately the only people who can decide if the financial output and admin demands of doing so are worth it. Developers simply can't tell an individual that they must keep paying for/running a server that they have lost interest in, or can no longer afford. If the player base wants to keep the server going, they need to be willing to put up real cash to take over the server and all associated tasks and costs. So perhaps instead of just closing a server the admin should offer it to the player base first to see if there are others willing to take it over. Another option would be to offer a way of servers being registered as a premium server where the admin undertakes to maintain the server for a certain period of time and not to make restarts in return for being allowed premium server status."

Admins take a look at the world and if there is a problem then they reset it. We are committed on keeping a world running but the Admin interface GUI is very complicated when it comes to manipulating the world.
I say if current users of a world are not wanting it to be reset or changes they should communicate with an admin.
For example- 3 months ago the world voted a leader that hastily started making laws on cutting down trees that prevented others form making homes, if the players had communicated to the Admin that there was a problem then the admin could have fixed the issue instead of the leader hindering others advancement."
ideas-feedback,Limitations on closing/restarting worlds | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5126/limitations-on-closing-restarting-worlds,423,12,10,SLG-Dennis,"Hello AMX,
i'll be answering as the owner of one of the most populated Eco-Servers instead of as Community Manager. We got several admins that play with the people (despite me, as i can't afford the time anymore, unfortunately) and communication with most is working great - especially with those players that are players that are there for several cycles in a row now. You can add the discord server to the tutorial and for us this works out pretty good. Don't expect the players to voice what they want, though. We ususally do a strawpoll vote on discord about server resets and have scheme of 30 days guaranteed uptime with followed reset votes that we wrote into the description so players can freely choose if they would like to play on that server. We never reset the server without asking the players on discord in a poll that needs to be won. I'd find it odd if players would need to come to you to tell you you should not reset, especially when they have no idea about that you plan to do so or that is an possiiblity at all. To have a good running server you really need to actively invest time to create a community and make people communicate - you will not be able to do this with everyone, but with most of your active players. It seems like you're not actively monitoring your server? A law like the one the leader did would have come to the attention of one of our admins pretty automatically and they would have taken care about that, too. It's only issues we cannot easily see, like property disputes and  griefing in the world that we need player reports and those we usually do indeed get."

ideas-feedback,Water behavior | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5205/water-behavior,142,2,1,quyxkh,"I'm new, let me relate my introduction to the game and how water behaves: I started out on a public server, they said ""oh, hey, do glassmaking, we're going to need glass in the north"", so I checked, realized sand was indeed a good route  and built near a mountain with four nice big nearby beaches. Left a dike around the first one, checked the map after clearing it, it said cedar yield potential for the whole thing was through the roof, planted one cedar seed and maybe half a dozen more cedars appeared within minutes.  Awesome.  It looks great, very cozy and agricultural and tended, my own private cedar supply, with the sea nearby it's beautiful.  The word ""bucolic"" floated to mind and that's the scene. Lovely. Left a dike around the second one, checked the map after clearing it, it said clam yield potential for the whole thing was through the roof, breached the dike and . . .  well, that was disappointing. Water behavior doesn't have to look awesome or happen at anything like ""realistic"" speeds, I get that fluid flow models eat petascale supercomputers, but I think it's reasonable to expect that water will eventually find its level."

The logistics of tracking hundreds of transactions among dozens of people is a technology in itself, so it's a bit odd to see it appear very early in the game. Especially as an educational game, treating those systems of exchange as a given seems like a missed opportunity. A few different thoughts on how this could be accomplished: Obviously currency will always be a part of the game, and it's an important part, but it would be great to see some alternatives available for experimentation (and those unfortunate times capitalism lets the meteor win)"

ideas-feedback,Different Meteor Types | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5190/different-meteor-types,121,1,1,BornAshes,"I'm copy pasting this from the IdeasFactory channel in discord after Pam recommended that I share this in the suggestions/ideas forum so that you amazing devs could take a look at it. Pam and me were talking and came up with this idea that maybe there could be a way to randomize the damage of a meteor via using the real world example that not all meteors are made of the same stuff and when they impact an atmosphere, not all meteors behave the same way or cause the same level of damage when they impact the surface of a planet. Perhaps the meteor was made up of nickle or iron and would concentrate its damage in one area or perhaps it would break up into pieces and cause a meteor shower every few days using a script that Pam wrote.  The damage would not always be catastrophic.  Sometimes a section of the world would be destroyed and sometimes everything would be gone with an ensuing nuclear winter type of environment.  The damage of the meteor (for more fun and just as a personal preference) should be RNG locked/set at the creation of the world so that no admins can tinker with it just because things aren't going their way.  There should be a strong sense of urgency.  It would force the community to either address the issue of the meteor right away for fear of total destruction or hope that they got lucky and would get away with only a glancing blow. This could also help to jumpstart the governance process that early stage servers seem to have an issue with.  There would be obvious sides to take from the start which would guide the progress of the server.  One party that wants to nuke it right away, another that wants to wait until things are more set up before deciding, another that wants to bunker it out, and another that just wants to hope for the best.  The appearance of the server, of how people build, of what they build with, how they progress, what kinds of skills they take, and how well the politics of the server mesh could be altered by the simple question of: ""What if the meteor doesn't destroy everything?"" which leads to more choices depending on how the server chooses to answer it. From what I've seen, the current meteor just blows everything to pieces and that's it game over no use rebuilding unless you're with a dedicated server that wants to keep going which seems to be super rare at the moment.  This would open up the possibility of being able to continue past the initial strike.  There's also the idea that the meteors don't stop depending on the composition of the initial one.  If a world gets hit with a small less damaging meteor then the chance of another meteor showing up is high.  If it gets hit with a larger more devastating meteor, then the chance of another one showing up is low.  The option for admins or modders being able to alter this is always on the table but I feel like if that initial sense of fear or urgency isn't there at the start then the players won't take as much agency in dealing with it and will rely on the admins altering the settings if things don't go their way."

ideas-feedback,Additional construction blocks and options | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5177/additional-construction-blocks-and-options,70,1,1,Careyn,"I am happy that it seems new block forms for construction materials are being added; but a few options for placement and additional forms would make constructing a nicer building possible. This feature alone would greatly add to building options.  Being able to place stairs and roof blocks alone would add the ability to slant the underside of structures and some of the full blocks would make alternate floor/ceiling textures available. Currently, the game will remove the wall junction post on the side that follows straight through.  This often leads to large flat walls with little detail.  It would add nicely to the aesthetics if we had a way to toggle the junction detail to show on flat walls. Due to the current block forms, a slab would need to be a third of a block to appear uniform.  In order to get the 1/3, 2/3, and full block, the current stack mechanic use with objects could modify the block ( i.e. place slab > place again to change to a double thick slab > place again to have a full block with slab texture. This option started as a suggestion I saw for adding a compactor to help manage tailings.  Simple idea, compact tailings to reduce space usage in the stockpiles.  This could be used to compact tailings (and similar blocks) 2:1 to make a block similar to stone/ores allowing you to place eight per block.  Then, expand this to allow four of this type block (including stone and ores) to create a full block that could be placed in the world.  This gives the option of building walls with natural blocks other than dirt/sand. I hope all this wasn't too long to read and made sense.  I doubt much of this, if any, would be added; but, as a builder, I would love to have more options for making better looking structures.  Please post any additional ideas or variations you may have or if you think all this would be pointless in a game where building isn't really the main objective.  :-)"

New skill: Herding
Herding Recipe 1: Herding Lasso from Fibers.
Herding Recipe 2: Paddocks (Varying sizes). Paddock Functionality: Functionally similar to storage with smaller capacity but can only hold one type of livestock. Periodically if there are 2+ livestock present and a free storage capacity, it might breed. Optional Extra: May require feed to enable breeding. Either fibers from grass etc, or add Animal Feed Recipe(s) with efficiency skills. Lasso Functionality: Can't be used while carrying. Target similar to bow, but slow descent. On hit (% chance for animal to escape could be another skill saving), animal captured. Carried item becomes ""led animal"". This can be deposited in paddock or placed on ground at which stage it becomes a wild animal again.

ideas-feedback,Power Utility Company | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5113/power-utility-company,230,1,1,QuakeIV,"It would be very nice if there were some way to specialize into making specifically power, to run power lines connecting people to an energy grid, and to be able to build meter boxes to charge them for the amount of kilowatt-hours of energy they are using.

ideas-feedback,My ideas to improve the game | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5100/my-ideas-to-improve-the-game,234,1,1,Zloyvoin,"Hello everyone, after several hours of gameplay with two friends on our private server wie have some ideas what could possibly improve the gameplay: some general thoughts:
I think the current skill gaining system is way too passive. Mostly we gain skillpoints for housing and eating the right food but not for our work. I know it is possible to change it in the configs but in my opinion it should be baseline in the game, that you get much more reward for your actions in game and not just from passive things. It feels just wrong and not really rewarding - also it slows down the gameplay alot. Another thing i want to mention is, that the developer should spice up the endgame. The idea to stop the meteor is of course nice but it is also not very challenging and most people just enjoy the building and growing your economy. That's why i thought some NPCs where you can sell goods or add in general NPCs where you could get reputation for tasks and special rewards would improve the game alot. Maybe this could also be added just optional for the Server Admins if you want to play so or not. And one more big thing in direction to the developers. Please think about to build a simple Game Editor, just think about successfull games like skyrim / warcraft III who added a very easy to understand / handle  game editor. Those games was mostly successfull because it was so easy to add content driven by the community. I really would love if strangeloopgames could think about it. In my opinion this game doesn't need more items / blocks at the moment, it definetly should look foward to add better endgame content. Give people reasons to play the game constantly - spice it up with more objectives during you care for your world."

It always is complicated as world leader to distinguish between government affairs and private affairs, especially when it comes to things like finances and contracts."

ideas-feedback,Vehicle Feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5075/vehicle-feedback,341,2,1,Trenix,"Right now there is just too many balance issues because all you need to do is buy a few vehicles and many skills and professions, become useless. Players are doing jobs that they otherwise never specialized in. A person doesn't just get into a vehicle and know exactly what to do, they require training. While it's true that many machines do take over manual labor, there is always a trained professional behind the machine. I play a high specialization server and the only reason people buy rock, iron, or other resources, is not because they're unable to, but because they don't want to. It's breaking the economic aspects of the game."
ideas-feedback,Vehicle Feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5075/vehicle-feedback,341,2,2,Kryzzk,"Hate to disagree with you, but there are many other things that would be far better in my opinion. I learned to drive a car by getting behind the wheel, I learned to drive a Skid Steer and a Excavator the same way, professional Training? nope, never had it and I was a lot better than some of the guys that had it. Never used a hand plough but lets be real, how much training would you really need to push a blade in a strait line? as for the tractor, I have used real tractors with no professional training, lets face it, it's an oversized lawn mower with a PTO to the back, put it in gear, drop the attachment, engage the POT and drive. Takes practice to do a great job, but anyone can do it without any training. That said, I do think that if you are not a Farmer then you should not be able to just up and use farming equipment without a penalty of some sort and the same with the Excavator, the skid steer, well, any joe blow can rent and use one just about anywhere in the US, granted they are no where near as strong as they are in the game but still. I think linking the equipment to the associated Skill should be sufficient, but even that Idea I don't like as I am not a professional in any field that uses the above equipment, but yet I can, and have jumped on them and used them, I also 100% disagree with requiring a skill to be unlocked for the trucks, my 13 year old can get in the car and drive and she has never had any training on it."

Here a few little things i would love to see implemented: 1- Double clicking on ""Your Worlds"" not login you directly in the game.  We need to select the server and then click the ""join"" button.  would be nice to just double click the server name under LAN. 2- When we use the Repair Station, after clicking the ""Repair"" button, please, move back the item to my inventory ! Any slot of it! in taskbar or backpack. Many time I've repair stuff from my base-camp to figure out, when down the mine that my pickaxe was up there in the repair station!  (OK, now I've build a repair station right into the mine just because of it!). 3- Be able to split the stack.  Shift click or something to split the food our farmer produce. 4- Starting inventory.  Would be nice to start with a few seeds of tree and food.  Right now, when we start fresh new on a server, food all have been harvested, tree all chop down !  Would be nice if we would be able to start our own little garden and tree farm on our land claim. I really love this game, kudo on the stockpile implementation !  I'm still a noob starting but i like it so far! Thank for giving me an great alternative for Min*****ft ! John"

You shouldn't be able to break it down into pieces of road. People are selling ramps and telling others to break them down. It's also annoying breaking a ramp down and getting roads, which you can't build back into a ramp. I also exploit ramps because of the way they work, by buying dirt ramps and breaking them down into dirt to make it easier to transport dirt. It's wrong."

And even if you are using a bloomery or blast furnace i guess in an iron ore you will get some other minerals in low quantities to.
ideas-feedback,Idea: Geological ocurrence of minerals | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/5018/idea-geological-ocurrence-of-minerals,373,3,3,alexarthur94,"That would be awesome! I hadn't thought much about making more realism to the occurrence of minerals.

ideas-feedback,Reworked / Proper Mining/Smelting & Proper Cement | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4953/reworked-proper-mining-smelting-proper-cement,442,2,1,Snoberry,"Generally I understand the need to simplify the process of refining ore into metal for most games, but since Eco is so in-depth I'd really like to see the process expanded on and made more accurate. I especially don't like the current system, where smelting ore produces tailings whether you use the bloomery or the blast furnace (either instance is incorrect, as smelting the ore does not produce tailings) My suggestion is as follows: Expand the mining and refining process to follow a more realistic approach used in the real world, laid out in these steps below. Finding/Uncovering Veins of Ore -> Mining Ore Body -> Crushing Ore (Produces Oxides and Tailings) -> Smelting Oxides (Produces Metal and Slag) This would require a new workbench to be implemented, maybe at 2 tech levels. One at the base level with the bloomery, a basic Rock Crusher, which would slowly crush ore into Oxides (the valuable mineral portion of ore) and tailings (the uneconomical/useless portion of the ore). Tailings would not have to be changed, although I feel like increasing the amount/spread of their pollution should be done. The workbench would be called a ""Stamp Mill"" and should be built of wood and stone, and require mechanical energy to function either from a windmill or waterwheel. The 2nd tier, which would be at the same level as the bloomery and also be used for making concrete, would be an Electric Rock Crusher. It would require electricity to run, and crush ore faster, as well as being able to perform two other functions. It would take rock and crush it into ""Calcium Silicate"" and it would take Slag and crush it into ""Aggregate"" This structure would of course still produce tailings from ore. Then you would take the Oxides obtained by crushing and smelt them into metal ingots at the Bloomery or Blast Furnace. Both would produce slag, although the bloomery would produce less usable metal and more slag, and the blast furnace would produce more usable metal and less slag with a byproduct of air pollution. Slag would be used as above at the Rock Crusher to make Aggregate. This would facilitate the small change to cement and concrete. ""Concrete"" as it is in game would change from ""Concrete"" to ""Cement"" and be produced at the Cement Kiln by baking Calcium Silicate from the Rock Crusher. Cement would retain its status as a non-building ingredient material. A new recipe would be added ""Concrete"" to replace the one changed to ""Cement"". It would require Cement and Aggregate to create, and would replace ""Reinforced Concrete"" as the Tier 3 building material. Finally, ""Reinforced Concrete"" would be changed to a Tier 4 building material and would require Cement, Aggregate, and Rebar to be produced."

ideas-feedback,Seeds for all plant species; survival of rare plants | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4997/seeds-for-all-plant-species-survival-of-rare-plants,201,1,1,alexarthur94,"On a few servers I've been on, there have been a couple species that have a tendency to be very rare, IE, pitcher plants, bullrush, and sometimes creosote bushes. What's unfortunate is that with tiny populations, even when their habitats are completely undisturbed, they have a tendency to go extinct because their reproduction rate doesn't equal or exceed their death rate. It would be nice if the algorithms could be adjusted a little so that things wouldn't die out if they and their environment are unharmed by players' activities. On the same note, it would be nice if seeds could be collected from any type of plant. For instance, many of the plants I harvest for fiber, such as salal and most grasses, have never given me seeds. If we could produce seeds from every type of plant species, it would give us more options in terms of habitat restoration if needed and also gardening. Once again, it's an awesome game, and thank you for all your hard work! :D"

Here are a couple of ideas:
Oak (Acorns were used by Native Americans as a food source, so it would be cool if they were a more useful food in the game and if oak trees yielded a useful amount of acorns for food).
California black walnut
American plum (native to North America from the Great Plains and eastward; not sure if this is supposed to be covered by the game, but I thought I'd mention it)
American persimmon (native to the Southeast starting in eastern Texas and Oklahoma; again, not sure if in scope) Also, for plant fibers, there are species of cotton native to some areas of North America, so that might be something interesting to add to the game. :D"

ideas-feedback,User Interface Improvements and Dropping things | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4996/user-interface-improvements-and-dropping-things,188,1,1,beelzerob,"The game is lacking in a few of areas when it comes to ease of use.  For instance, being able to transfer stacks of items from one container to the next.  Most games allow for holding down a key on the keyboard and clicking the stack to transfer the whole thing at once.  Is the clicking and dragging meant to be arduous? Dropping was mentioned about a year ago, and the response was that the trash system would take care of that.
The trash system (at least in some form) now exists, but the ability to drop something would still be VERY appreciated (even if it becomes trash when you do it). The first issue with the trash system is that dragging something down to trash causes it to appear underneath you and pop you up one block.  This became a big problem when I had dug a cavern to store trash in and my head kept popping through to the other side of the voxel whenever I put down some trash.  It would be nice if the default behavior was to place the trash in the spot in front of the player, and then below the player only if that spot wasn't a valid option. The second issue is that I'd really like to be able to make a landfill by simply dropping items from my inventory.  Most games when you drop something it flings it a little way in front of you.  I'd love to be able to do that at the lip of my hole and throw items into it.  Right now, throwing anything away is difficult to do.  Not to complain too much about realism, but in the real world, throwing something away is about the easiest thing to do.  Let there be consequences...bring on the consequences!!  But don't make discarding items something I rarely do just because it is so cumbersome. Having to place individual shovel fulls can really be a hassle sometimes getting the spot to highlight.  Just letting me drop the shovel full of dirt and it will fall down to where-ever is below it would be such a nicer way to fill in holes.  I know that dirt placed right now will fall down until it hits something, but you still have to PLACE that shovel full.  I'd rather just be able to dump the shovel-full wherever it happens to be. Love the game, keep it up."

I had a look at the roadmap, and I gotta say, every single feature listed as planned looks absolutely amazing and stunning. I can't wait to see how this game develops. Me and my friends picked it up the other day after trying it and finding just how amazing it already is. Anyway, to the point; On the roadmap, I noticed that there's no plan for making weather a thing in the game. I feel like weather, whilst not necessary for the core gameplay, could massively deepen the experience for players. Plants needing a lot of water? Put them in an area where it rains a lot. Dumping pollutants into the sea? Uh oh, they were swooped up with the condensation and is now raining down all over the planet. Yes, implementing all of the different, complicated effects weather could have on the world would be a difficult project, but oh my goodness would it add to immersion and depth. That's my two cents at least. What do you guys think?"
ideas-feedback,Suggestions: Weather | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4948/suggestions-weather,453,5,2,alexarthur94,"There are some effects related to weather. For instance, on the minimap, you can see layers for rainfall and soil moisture. Areas with greater soil moisture, for instance, can more easily get ground pollution from air pollution.

It has become much harder to move items from one stockpile to the next as the tooltip is giant and you can't move anything through the tooltip. You're dancing around trying to move the cursor far out of the way to not go near another item lest you become tooltip blocked. Instead of it just staying there it should disappear right after you move the cursor away from it and you should still be able to move things through the tooltip. Maybe even when in a stockpile there be a check to if you want tooltips while in there or not. As of right now it is extremely obnoxious to move anything from my stockpiles

I do agree that bug fixes is crucial right now. We have duplication, room breaking, server crashes, and shop breaking quite excessively. I'm sure this is why many people aren't playing or remaining active. If people leave to that, it's difficult to do anything without the missing professions. Also I'm not sure if I agree with the lower system requirements. It's already pretty low as it is. Most games have the same minimum and if you have specs lower than that, you should definitely consider upgrading. my decade old computer is still much higher than the minimum requirements needed."

I'm curious then, as a social experiment, what would happen if a server was established to have a kind of Monarchy situation where the people have no voting rights (if that is even possible), and in such a scenario could enough players ever ignore the laws? Although, when you think about it, democracy really is the greatest form of tyranny because a minority group can easily be unrepresented regardless. Beyond that, it would be interesting to see a group of players rebel against their government and establish a new government territory. For example, one group makes a single monetary system and then another group agrees on a different currency. Just like real life."

This would be a great new feature regarding that a community of villagers has to volunteer and fight the bushfires to prevent the fire from spreading and to keep the air pollution low. But you could start fires on your own to clear large forests. Of course this will have a massive air pollution. You could start with a small wooden cart with a human powered pump to pump water from a small creek or river through a hose and extinguish the fire. Later, when technology is gained you could replace that cart with a small fire truck with its own tank and a gas powered pump. I hope someone is excited by my idea and can post it in the dev forum because i have no acces there."

I also just thought of water carrying items for tier 1 construction. it came up as an idea before we get aqueducts for irrigation in farming. Firefighting is a great idea.

A bucket could carry 1 volume(assuming water would get a weight similar to other items) of water and degrade over time like tools(non stack able when full)"" A water cart could carry possibly 5 or 10 volumes of water, but the cart itself wont degrade over time.

ideas-feedback,Some ideas. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4694/some-ideas,431,2,1,Eprisable,"First of all i want to say i really like the game! :)
• Able to delete worlds (when you open the game).
• A way to vieuw information/statistics about the plants in game. Crop temperature and moisture preferences. (like the overvieuw on the wiki).
•Being able to place all building blocks in all directions like upside down stairs and side way pillars.
• Nuts, like walnuts, hazelnuts etc. would be nice for vegan diet. (also more divers mushroom and legumes).
• Drinks, staying hydrated.
• Greenhouses as a specialty,  You are able to grow crops even tho its not in the ideal area. The more you research the more you can add to the greenhouse. Late game control it with computer.  Early game greenhouse can only grow tomatoes beets and beans. The more you progress the more you can grow. (cactus prickly pear etc.) something like that. Also grow decorative plants and flowers.
• Sunflowers, pumpkins, fruit trees.
• plants that have an extra positive effect on the environment. Some plants are good for clean air, some for the soil etc.
• Add workplace/garage as a new room to the house? Workbench, repair table, (carts) decorative stuff etc (still able to place outside for early game).
• Beekeeping. For honey and wax.
• ride a bicycle could be fun :) (yes, im dutch)
• Writing; books, notes, newspaper, posters, letters etc. Maybe a special bookshelf where you can store notes and your research stuff with something that you can easly archive and find stuff.
• Art? the expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power. :) Photography? Make a poster of your screenshot.
•crystals and gems for jewelry, house crystals, sculpture etc wich give special benefits.
• When you destroy bob the meteor, pieces of the meteor fall on the planet. The pieces have new resourse that allow you to do space research and find other planets and go into space. :)"

ideas-feedback,More threats to players | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4402/more-threats-to-players,767,4,1,Wicked_one,"Loving this game so far. However.. I believe the game would benefit largely with having more threats to the player. Considering you can throw yourself off a cliff and survive (only saying ""ouch"" and losing 10 calories),  you can starve for eternity and you don't need to sleep.  Not to mention how you can witness the asteroid colision and live to tell the tale. It would be so cool to have the option of bunkering down to try and survive the apocolypse if you weren't able to stop it. Some additions such as fall damage, starvation, hydration,  stamina, and hostile animals (such as bears, lions, wolves and sharks in the water) would add so much immersion to the game and opportunity to add a medic profession. Also weather could coincide with the hydration thing pretty well if you could collect water from rain and store in water tanks, not to mention clouds and rain would look awesome in this game. Just a suggestion :)"
ideas-feedback,More threats to players | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4402/more-threats-to-players,767,4,2,Razorflare,"Stamina is in the game, its the release of calories as you work. Starvation, though we dont DIE, you are affected by not gaining any skill points and thus cannot do any work till you eat. Hostile animals, their are wolves, but i do not think the dev, are ready to add more ""predator animals"" ..yet. i think the reason wolfs are in the game, is because if you were a kickstarter that payed over 400$ you got the ability to tame them. According to the kickstarter page, only 24 ppl paid that level. Also, i think they are also their to ensure the Elk, Hare, Turkey dont over populate.....who knows, i could be wrong. Hydration would be a great addition, we just need a tier 0 or 1 solution to gathering water. maybe tier 0 could be our hands to drink directly from water source, tier 1 could be a bucket/small water cart..... As for the immsersion of taking damage/dieing, i dont think thats what the developers are trying to create in this game."

But I could see the use of having skill point reductions/burning through extra calories if the player is exposed to pollution. It would create an additional incentive to manage it carefully. Also, in case you didn't know, the ecosystem overall is based on western North America. That's why there is the specific set of fauna. So lions wouldn't be an option (unless down the road they make one for Africa), and although bears could be an option, the world size is probably too small to support a population of bears."

ideas-feedback,Please Adjust Farming | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4919/please-adjust-farming,330,2,2,AraJudge,Something I would add about farming that I brought up in the discord is that it is really hard to tell where you have planted a crop or not in the fields. This is because most of the crops are just little tiny ity bity stems when you plant them. So they are hard to see. Adding something to it would make it a lot easier to tell that something is planted in that square or not especially when you are using the sower on the tractor.
ideas-feedback,Greenhouse and compost bin suggestion | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4908/greenhouse-and-compost-bin-suggestion,245,1,1,Kryzzk,"I suggest adding a Placeable structure that you craft from lumber and glass on the saw table that would let you grow all planets and crops that you can get seeds for even if you are not in their biome, it would need fertilizer for fuel (and maybe add buckets, pipes and water pumps so that it could also need water that the player would have to use a bucket to add, or attach pipes and power a pump to get the water to it). If the fuel runs out the plants die and have to be replanted. I also suggest a compost bin to allow players to take items/trash and turn them into fertilizer, Items/trash could be placed into the compost bin and would turn into contaminated dirt (or just dirt/compost) over time. To make fertilizer from the dirt/compost the player might have to add meat or vegetables (and water if that gets added to the game) to the bin."
ideas-feedback,MORE IDEAS and feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4901/more-ideas-and-feedback,421,3,1,greengo,"Eco is exactly the type of game I am looking for. but the different skill sets need to be totally independent of one another. I should be able to choose to be a mason, for instance, without having to become a carpenter first.  You
should be able to succeed in the game with any ONE of the skill sets, and not have to learn many.  Often, I would want to advance in one skill set, but have to go back and raise another so I could get a crucial ingredient totally unrelated to the skillset I was focussing on. I have ideas about the skill trees too, but that would require a very detailed and lengthy post. I get you want to have environmental consequences, but tailings are WAY too
severe.  I bet people have buried skyscrapers of tailings. it's ridiculous. IF you want to have people be aware of their impact on the environment, they need a way to MONITOR it AND a way to affect change or manage it AT EVERY LEVEL of the game.  Just having the game go: ""Oh, look, you are killing your world""
is NOT productive or educational.  What point is having a problem you can do nothing about? IF we can't SOLVE the problem or at least work on it to reduce it, There is no learning taking place. I wonder if there is a better world building algorithm? Settings for what kind of terrain and layout should be able to be chosen on game startup, before you let the game make a world.  I would like to see more plains, and since you have ramps, why not use them for terrain in game?  Everything doesn't HAVE to
be so blocky.  MY test world was so random it was almost impossible to navigate. Speaking of navigating, you BADLY need a compass and labels for plants and ores when highlighted on screen. having to actually harvest, then throw away something if it is not what you want is poor game control.  (and the trash thus made NEVER goes away, even if it is just plants or harmless rock) You BADLY need instructions we can refer to.  I repeatedly had to go to forums to find out
commands or how to work something. This shouldn't be guesswork. Speaking of guesswork, Farming is just that. We get no idea when a planting will harvest and no notification when its ready.  I had plants die repeatedly and harvest was minimal, even at max farming skill level. (I can't do fertilizer and it makes no sense.)  again, instructions?  I tried chopping off lower limbs of trees so I could see and move under them in some cases, but that killed the trees!  Lower limbs on trees HAMPER a trees growth, not kill it. The other thing that bothers me is the room requirements. typically, most of hte machines used DO NOT require a room in real life,  sometimes only a roof, and why they need so much free room around them is beyond me. IT makes no sense.  IF you MUST have such a requirement, you need some sort of visual in
teh game showing you how much room it needs. the meters squared info is
meaningless. How big IS a game block? 1 meter? I am not good at math so if I build a room 3 blocks high inside, I have no idea how many blocks a machine table needs, so I cannot tell how big to build the house. I say eliminate that. it serves n o real purpose except to frustrate players. Why does everything have a deed? IF I lose my deed there seems to be no way to replace it.  YOu should be able to click on a cart and MAKE a deed for it right there if you want to sell it (which would be the only reason I can see FOR a deed) It would be nice to be able to USE house furnishings like the bed.  When it stats getting dark, go to bed and time slips by faster (If that works in a multiplayer game.)  I kinda assume there is no time zones in play.  OR going WITHOUT laying down reduces efficiency WHEN you get a bed.  (no, I don't want to see my avatar go to the potty.) HOw about an in game store? I have looked all over my planet a far as I can tell, and have no camas bulbs. That means I cannot learn higher level cooking of any kind. a store would solve this or change the requirements for learning to
something besides ingredients.  At least alternative ingredients for a book.  (ps, why books at all? all they do is clog up inventory or trash heaps. I would like it if learning produced the disappearing scroll only."
ideas-feedback,MORE IDEAS and feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4901/more-ideas-and-feedback,421,3,2,Funnybunnyofdoom,"@greengo said: This is meant to require players to work together with others. You can't be a mason without a carpenter in your world. You can't be a smith without a mason, and so on. This is to force you to cooperate or trade with other players to get things done. One of my servers actually has a 5 skill cap, so you must work together. Yes, they are working on it and it needs much more work. They removed the construction from the skill tree and gave it to everyone for free. They also need to work on making specs such as paper milling and fertilizers more useful. Currently those trees are pointless. There are also some skills that have benefits that unlock nothing beyond level 2 but still go to level 5. I have seen the devs mention that the tailings from the Blast Furnace will be changed into Slag eventually. I don't know how that will impact the storage, but we also have the ability to change settings on our servers. I am currently looking at increasing the effects of pollution on my low-rate long term server. You can  monitor the issue through your map with the ""group pollution"" and ""air pollution"" layers. You can also check the stats tab. (I think G button). To reverse the effect of all your stuff dying from tailings, simply bury them deep down in a stockpile surrounded in stone in the ground. We store our tailings in the mason's stone mine. The world Generator is a little difficult to operate, but you may want to generate a world with a max slopes setting of 3.0. This will give you more rolling hills. Talk to people on the official discord for more information about world genning, but I have heard that the world generator will be revamped in one of the coming updates. The world is hard to walk about. The crags and ravines are sickening. But you don't need ramps in the world gen, you can walk up 1x tall blocks. Buuut. One of the biggest and most popular challenges of this game is getting a robust road network and road-building group to expand your roadways as more vehicles come online. I have heard that a WAILA (What am I looking at?) like feature is being worked on by the devs. This should tell you what your cursor is aiming at. The plant trash should decompose after about 24 hours IRL (if you play single player, you gotta keep the world running). The solid waste will turn into trash blocks and can be handled like tailings. We usually have a trash guy who gets paid by the government to handle it. I don't know what you mean about guesswork though, you can use the tooltips for information. In order to know when your crops are ready to harvest, you must buy/make a soil sampler. Fertlizers are almost useless atm, but it's necessary to get it to make soil samplers. I suggest making a bunch, selling them and dropping the Fertlizer skill. Everyone should have a soil sampler. It tells you when your crops are done, when the trees are fully grown(They give the most seeds this way) and smiths can use them to report the pollution in their immediate area without using the map. Yes, you should be able to shop the lower limbs of a tree of, say to allow the flow of road traffic. Unfortunately, that needs worked on. The addition of the chainsaw was amazing, but still Woodcutting needs a log of work. I suggest going to the official website, the account section, and voting on the roadmap. Right now, math is essential to the game. You need to calculate blocks used. You need to think about your efficiency levels. You need to think about what it costs you to make an item, even down to the calorie cost in food. You need to calculate what one player should be selling items at with their efficiency level so you do not over pay. You can get by without, but if you have self-admittedly poor math skills I suggest setting up a google spreadsheet with easy enter data to calculate things for you so you don't need to. I hope they add calculation tools into the game! They are fortunately adding a lot to the tooltips already. What version are you playing on? 7.6.3 is what my servers are running, and we no longer have deeds. They have been replaced with ""Real Estate Table"". Suggest items like your bed idea separate than long rants like this. That is a good idea. Make sure they see that. Perhaps sleeping in a bed reduces the amount of calories you burn when you log out. I suggested that latrines produce waste, and you must remove the waste like air pollution in order to keep getting points from your bathroom. This game is 100% player run. In order to have a store, you need a player to run it. You can't buy things from your own store, so even an admin store will do nothing. You need to have a friend join your game, and you can spawn in items with admin commands, and have him set up a store where he can buy items. On my servers I sell items in an admin shop that cannot be obtained such as fir seeds and claim papers. All of your complaints have led me to conclude that there should be a single player mode added to the game as soon as it's plausible. Time flow should be calculated while the server is off in single player mode(turn your single player world on, and it calculates what happened while it was off). The shop generation command should have a bot option so you can buy things on simple player. Perhaps a dummy player to give your shop properties to like an ""npc"". Fortunately, there is something you can do. In the Ecosim file in the config folder, you can change the growth rate of your plants to grow much faster if you are on a single player world that isn't online. I  hope you find a good world with lots of helpful people to play on! This game is nearly unplayable alone. Enjoy!"
ideas-feedback,MORE IDEAS and feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4901/more-ideas-and-feedback,421,3,3,greengo,"IT does just the opposite. forcing me to use materials I don't want to use doesn't encourage coop playing.  If I choose to be a mason, why would I WANT bricks or boards? why am I forced to have to use them?  I really don't mind that as far as furniture and other incidentals. That's cool. so, as a mason, I can trade for wood to make chairs, beds and the like, but it should NEVER prevent me from advancing in the game and making what I want, if I want to.  right now I just learned I need brick or lumber to make a factory so I can make a truck or other things. I can't because I built a huge 261 square mortared stone house/room and another 17 one, but now I have to either tear one down and build with brick or build a new one somewhere I didn't want to out of brick when I HAVE plenty of room already.  I made my rooms big JUST so I wouldn't have to rebuild, not imagining you'd have out have a specific type of building out of specific material. absurd.  Playing alone, as I am, all it means is I am now at a point I can DO NOTHING unless I tear down a big portion of my house and rebuild it or build another house that I should not need to since my current house is plenty big.   As I said earlier, I can see having to go back and learn another skill tree, playing alone, to be able to build certain things, but not a house or shed totally unrelated to the machine I need to build. ANY form of shelter should work. wood, stone, mortared stone, brick, steel , whatever, should be fine for ANY building over ANY machine. AS it is, if you force people to have to spend time learning skills they don't want in order to get to the point they can learn the skill they want, they are not happy.  Why can't I learn to make cars right up front while others are learning how to make the materials?  Then by the time the materials become available, I have my factory all ready to go. Now I have to either learn the other skills myself or wait till someone else does. I cannot even START to learn a specific skill till I have mastered many other skills I don't want to learn and shouldn't need to.  each skillset needs to be independent of each other in order for coop to work, not try to force the need by making irrational building requirements.  see how that is more of a problem than a solution? I should be able to be a car manufacturer waiting only for  someone to make steel and motors, or a windmill manufacturer waiting for others to provide materials I can use to make my specific skill sets thing. THAT's how people would and should work together, by having each thing require a skillset to build and people select what thing they are gonna be the supplier of.  Not say oh, you can't build a machine shop in anything but a brick house. That's ludicrous. say as a machinist, I have ot wait for others to make the materials for that THING I am skilled at building, and likewise THEY have to come to ME for that thing, and can't make it themselves. right now things that should be a specific skill are learned automatically in general. THAT's what is killing coop play. each skillset should allow a person to make products others need, what world generator? I haven't seen any such thing I can access. That's my point. I am sure there is something in the background defining the world but it should be configurable in the game up front. I know I can walk about in the world, but I can't even pull a cart. THAT's my point. IF there were slopes all over a cart would work. no reason why it should not.  Can't even imagine what happens when you get a truck. IT can't climb either, I bet. my trash is usually non-toxic items. so you are telling me that those blocks of trash that I have made out of the most innocuous things will pollute, no matter what unless I treat them as tailings? oh brother. how do I get tool tips to tell me what things are I run across in the world?  Not even sure how to turn them on, assuming they are off. I made a soil sampler. don't know what it means. IF the soil is not perfect for a crop, what do I do? idk. if fertilizers worked, as you say, then maybe it would say needs potash or lime or whatever to raise ph or lower it, and what to do it with for each crop. as is, it is unworkable. I am playing 7.4.7  I see no way to update it nor any auto update. One of the reason I play computer games is so the computer does calculations for me.  Especially as I said, when I have NO IDEA what is required or what is a good level of anything.   I dont get that I am penalized for things I can't control.  IF calorie consumption figures in somehow, what do I do if I can't make something efficiently? how do I even know if I am efficient or not. nothing says "" you can make this, but you will have to eat ten steaks"" or some such.""  What I Am saying is I have no idea how big teh space is required for a machine to fit in a room. assuming one block IS one meter I can get a rough idea, but how do I know of the program is figuring it using every possible configuration to account for the requirements. I mean does it count ""free"" spaces anywhere in the house or contiguous ones only? I can't tel what spaces current machines are ""using"" or counting in THEIR requirements, so how can I know what is available for a new machine? Thanks for responding."

I feel the specialities (professions) should be attainable through SP use, but that further growth of said speciality should be experience driven. As you buy the skill, but need to actively use it to get more profficient at it. So at the beginning you would take longer and use more materials than when you are experienced at it. Just like in real life, you are not an expert at the beginning. And if you cannot use SP to gain these advantages it would make these proficient users desirable. Even at late game, because those skills also require more materials than what we see now. As it is now, people just save up SP till they have enough to max a given skill. That way they do not waste materials. And when they are done with that skill they dump it to choose a new one. If you take away the ability to be a master at once, people may hold on to the professions for longer and still be relevant. An example would be: Mason -> Glassworker -> Electronic Engineering (Fiberglass -> Substrate -> Circuit) If you just choose these professions but do not use them (0% efficiency), this would cost you alot of materials. In this scenario: 1 Circuit would cost: You could potentially craft a ton of materials for future use, but it would be both time consuming and taxing on storage space. This change would make the impact we humans have on the planet more noticable if we choose to be inefficient. Or are unskilled. Every server I have played loses any point to proffesions after just a few days, due to them being so easy to max and therefore crafting a ton of the needed mats and then dumping the profession. You can even queue crafting then dump it to keep producing.. 2 -
A skill check during production that prevents queueing a ton of crafting then changing skills. 3 -
Hosuing SP gain removed, and replaced with skill enhancing bonus. Efficiency, crafting time or other. Specific to the profession. For example to be a efficient woodworker you need to have a Forestry Cabin, that requires the workbench of the craft, and that it has for instance a set amount of trees in its vicinity. Making it a point to build your base to accommodate different professions. Not just build a tower with everything crammed in together. TL:DR: I think the current SP system along with how specialities currently work, does not really make people work together as skills are too easy to aquire as well as their easy upgrade. And the impact we have on the planet is minimal due to high efficiency with little to no work."

ideas-feedback,Feedback after 20hrs of SP only | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4823/feedback-after-20hrs-of-sp-only,968,7,5,boots01,"Micha you need Bison carcasses for research - butchery, I think. I take your point about my MP experience - I am in the process of starting up a server with some friends. I can see that railroads would be more important for MP, and I can see that the notion of a player economy is one of the more exciting parts of Eco. But there are so many games with economies and railroads - minecraft (with mods) is one that immediately springs to mind. Eco offers a chance to be something so much bigger and better. When I say 'players don't know what's good for them', I refer not to Eco players specifically, but players of games more broadly. They have a habit of asking games that are different to be the same as games they already play - see the preponderance of FPS games in Steam's top 20, or the requests to put weapons in Subnautica, or the desire to get rid of Hardcore mode  from They Are Billions. I'm not saying Eco players are dumb - I'm saying the devs should stick to their guns and make the environment the key part of the game. Players always want the same thing and the success the game already has should show that they know better than the players."
ideas-feedback,Feedback after 20hrs of SP only | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4823/feedback-after-20hrs-of-sp-only,968,7,6,boots01,Oh also in response to your first question Mica: Agriculture makes no sense because nothing grows while you're offline. it's very hard to get a farm going unless you leave your machine running all day and night.
ideas-feedback,Feedback after 20hrs of SP only | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4823/feedback-after-20hrs-of-sp-only,968,7,7,zytukin,"I think a good solution for farms would be to make crops in single player only take at most an hour to grow.  With them taking 24+ hours, you basically need a humongous farm to get enough crops to eat while working until you get cooking researched and progressing. I agree 100% about players and what they want.
If devs only followed players suggestions then it could (theoretically) become a completely different game.  What if ""eliminate the entire pollution system"" gets suggested and becomes the top voted for suggestion?  The main aspect of the game would be gone.  Players often only look at short term play goals and not long term playability.  Water takes the path of least resistance.  Most players want instant gratification and ease of completion for satisfaction of winning (the happy 'I succeeded' feeling) so suggestions may be geared towards accomplishing this.  They succeed in 'winning', get bored because they don't want to replay because they already won, and possibly leave negative reviews or complain about the game being too short or too easy to complete.  This isn't a criticism of players, it is just an observation gained from 20+ years of internet gaming including 10 years of running servers for an internet game that is now closed.  It is simply human nature to want to ""finish"" something efficiently and quickly, how efficiently and quickly depends on ones personality regarding their desire for closure and fear of failure. But it is a fine line to tread.  The dev's have to keep the game entertaining enough to keep the player base happy and keep the game selling while still maintaining control of preserving their personal desires for the game so it doesn't just become another voxel based minecraft clone.  When I ran game servers my ideology was ""I don't change things after the server opens so if you don't like it go elsewhere"".  But there was no income to worry about so it didn't matter if my servers succeeded or failed.  Any changes players wanted wouldn't happen until the server was closed to start over from the beginning up to 6 months later."
ideas-feedback,Some suggestions | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4877/some-suggestions,394,3,1,brandon_lee,"So there is this game called, Rising World, In which, there are building methods way better than blocks; methods that allow you to go beyond blocks with wooden planks and wooden beams. I think that wooden planks and beams for building would be great for ECO! Adding wooden beams and planks will make building more challenging and will make building more time demanding(some users prefer that) than just placing boring blocks(no hate intended). Also another thing(allot of users probably already mentioned) would be TNT for mining! The Excivator is very effective, however can make quite a bit of a mess...why shouldn’t TNT clear the way without the mess, and leave the Excivator for more...digging? I feel that the storage slots in the Excivator just isn’t enough for that kind of digging anyways. Maybe a slot addition should be required?

ideas-feedback,First run-through ideas and comments | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4703/first-run-through-ideas-and-comments,1760,18,3,greengo,"HI! VERY new to the game. only played two days RT so far. no manuals, so I just went in and played with things till i figured them out. Of course, made a lot of mistakes(?), not knowing. I cut a few trees to build things with, but wanted to start with stone walls. not knowing, I just mined stone and stacked them as walls around my base. lol. of course, later I realized that eh game didn't recognize that as built walls. so now I have been building wood walls after making a storage area.
First, I wanna say I have been looking for a game like this for 30 years..  The fact that I could dive in and get something done without any instruction is testament to good programming. I never tried minecraft because of teh block terrain, but I See now how it lends itself to destructible environment.
Biggest gripe (assumed) is the comet or meteor. I don't like having a forced time limit on the game. IT's not a problem yet, but I figure it will be.
First thing I noticed was that there was no on screen button to toggle first person. seems like it would help in hunting, maybe just me. I eventually found the z key, which allowed me to see the skill table. I did a LOT before I even knew it existed. I really don't se why one cannot learn skills without having a research table. I would have liked to farm or do masonry from teh start.
OH, before I forget, I tried to zoom in with the world  view and it just crashed 3 times, but I am using a pretty old computer, so it might just be that. Wish I could set it at a certain fixed zoom so i could get an overview quick and easy.
I would like to be able to merge all my deeds into one. Is that possible? It would have been far easier to use four stakes to claim an area or even more stakes for complicated layouts on an overhead view.  I have like 6 deeds and still don't have the area i want to mark as mine enclosed.
can't get hunting to work. can't get close enough and the arc thing is kinda ridiculous. have no way to determine where my shot is going. part is my rez has to be set so low, but why not a click on target and SKILL determines how well you hit?
will I die underwater? seems like a lot of stuff under there to get.
I could spend all my time building and reshaping the world. this is fun! oh, I am playing eh free version so far, but if you offer a version that can turn off teh comet, I'm in.
Oh yeah, when i first tried booting the program, it was set on high rez, so ti took forever to even get into the game. almost thought it wouldn't  make it. Could you make it load in low rez after install or use one of those algorithms that sees the capability of the machine and loads the most workable rez?
game play was a bit awkward, but once I learned it isn't so bad. Thanks for listening. Good job."

I reached teh level of total frustration. I have tried me damnedest to make a room to activate the research table, mason table, or carpenter table, but it says I don't have a room built. I tore down every thing I had built and built a wood 5x5 floor and two levels of walls and that is all I can do. it doesn't recognize it as a room even completely walled in.  It says I need hewn log level 1 to make steps or a roof, but I have no idea how to learn that when everything takes research and I can't get the table to work till the room is finished.
I tried making a new world and it just remade the same one with my same position and advancement. How do I start over? How do I delete worlds?  IS anybody paying attention?  HELLO!

At least if I ever get to activate any of the machines, i can use the wood to make other things when I go all masonry on the house. The tutorial, such as it is was saying ""do this"" but not how. IT eventually didn't come up again, when I couldn't surround the research table with a room, so I guess I got stuck there. Nothing tells me how to get next level of the ability to make roofs and such. I also cannot merge deeds or make new property stakes. I ran out because I could not tell the extent of the land I was encompassing, so I made some mistakes that I can't correct.I see no reason to have more than ONE deed.

okay, I've had the free version for about a week now. Pretty damn cool, but of course, I have issues. lol apologies for the typos, I am disabled and typing has gotten hard lately. why is there a separate dig and place button as well as a pick/use one? I get confused a lot even now as to which button I need to use, and often can't see the on screen instructions as I am looking too far up or down or too close. I could be wrong, but I see no reason we can't use the left mouse button for them
all.
kinda a minor note: a screen or button toggle for first person/third person switch. sometimes it helps. What I tend to need most is a local overhead view. I get lost a lot. This is made more necessary by the fact the map function now crashes immediately. being able to move in this mode would be nice too. A button in the setup to suspend or stop the meteor completely should be essential. I don't see why you made a built-in deadline into the game. I just want to build and explore. I want to spend my time changing the world as I fancy to. Don't want a deadline to race against. IS there a way to delete a game? I wanted to just start over, but the game spent a lot of time working and just made the same exact game I had, exactly where I was in the other. Pretty useless and defeats the purpose. Why doesn't the name of a plant pop up when I mouse over it? It would also be useful for other resources. You have to actually mine a rock to id it. Why not just mouse over and it says ""iron"" or ""coal"" or ""dirt"". Here's the bulk of my issues: irl you don't need to know carpentry to become a stoneworker, or bricklayer. Each skill should be totally independent of the others. Why can't I start out building houses and whatever out of stone if I want? I was forced to WASTE a lot of time messing around with wood when I didn't WANT a wood house or building. Requiring weird components that are often totally unrelated to a skill or the object you need to build is, well, ridiculous. speaking of houses, I built a three room wood one to put machines in and it didn't recognize that I have built a house. I finally built the stone one I started originally, and the same thing. what DOES constitute a house?
I find the room requirements ridiculous also. A draft table I can see needs a room, but why so much free space around it? carpenter bench might need a roof if you are in a rainy place, but I haven't seen any rain, a stoneworkers bench doesn't need to be inside, and most kilns and blast furnaces and many other
such things are usually outside, not inside. I built a big house and I can't even PUT any furniture in it. (not sure why we need furniture, but it would LOOK cool, I guess.
For that matter, why can't we dig into a cliff and make a set of cave rooms, and that be designated a house? I'd love that.
Then, you get to going down a skill tree and find you need to know a totally different, UNRELATED skill to progress in that skill. I am currently stuck because to make a stone blast furnace I need CLOTH, of all things. I can't make cloth because ultimately, I can't HUNT. I am using an old computer, so i have to
dumb down the rez, so I can't see well enough to shoot. the ridiculous arc makes it impossible to tell where I am aiming, and everything runs away for no reason. Animals that have never been hunted are not afraid of humans. Having the animal light up if you are on target would be great, but as an archer, I
can tell you the arc for a bow is not that bad. IT would actually be more accurate to reality to shoot straight. I'd lke to farm, but i need other items I can't get to even start ( as I understand it. there is no reference or instructions, oddly. We need an overview of how to proceed). Noting kills a game like
not even know what to do or how to do it. speaking of skills, skillbooks make no sense. not only does it generate a book to take up space in inventory unnecessarily, but then it generates a scroll, too. we don't need more things taking up inventory space. I also am appalled by tailings. Sure, metals production has a slag residue of impurities, but IT is SMALL and should be smaller for a game. I did some metalwork and had to spend the next HOUR getting tailings out of my inventory. Then I ended up with five huge tall towers of tailings. Then it says they are harmful to the environment, so I can't dump them somewhere out of the way, as hard as it is to pull them out of inventory. IF you MUST have them, make them far fewer and more manageable, hopefully
non-toxic. speaking of that, then there's trash. it has some of the same problem as tailings. I dropped a few books and a scroll or two and I get a mountain of trash. bit much, no? Why is there not a function to ""take all"" and place all up to the limit of the new container? It sure would be nice to be able to select the amount of a resource you want and not have to go back and replace the excess you didn't need, but while I am on that, why is not all inventory linked always? I have had to go get an item and carry it to a bench or workstation because even when linked it doesn't see it. I also can't seem to get the linked inventories to stay linked, or as I just said, get the stations to
pull from them. Footnote: I dropped a cart into the ocean. I can see it on the bottom of a deep bowl underwater. I Can't swim down to get it. There should be a way to retrieve it or destroy it or something. I (probably stupidly) assumed the cart would just follow me as I swam, not knowing its requirements. IT is also pretty useless in my world, which has a lot of mountains. Why cant it go up a slope I can?"
ideas-feedback,Water how to move it | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4476/water-how-to-move-it,927,2,1,Razorflare,"Is it possible to get a TIER 1 water carrying item, IE: a bucket, maybe even a small water pump cart. I feel like water progression should have been a bigger thing in the game. I understand their are water physics in the game with how water is affected by the aqueducts, but since we dont get brick till tier 2 and at the expense of many skill points to opening it up, that maybe if we have the option to use Mortared stone to create a ""still ponds"" that hold the water and overtime the water is absorbed into the ground as moisture. Also if rain is ever added, these still ponds can also hold water. Hewn logs could be used also but would lose water faster then mortared stone. Later, brick can be used to ensure a better water retention pond, and they can be linked to the aqueduct. As time progresses, the pipes can be used by either being buried into the ground or laid on top, and a sprinkler attachment can be added for aesthetics. here's a look at the tier progression i was thinking of . Tier 1 Nothing so far - maybe a bucket, water pump cart - something that requires the use of calories to move water A bucket could carry 1 volume(assuming water would get a weight similar to other items) of water and degrade over time like tools(non stack able when full) A water cart could carry possibly 5 or 10 volumes of water, but the cart itself wont  degrade over time. (although having vehicles degrade over time, could open up a new avenue of business for carpenters/engineers). the carts could stack water or stack the buckets. Tier 2 - we have working aqueducts Tier 3 - I believe pipes and pump stations are whats coming Tier 4 - improvements on tier 3 for speed, pressure, quantity that's moved I did'nt go into the other tiers because most ppl already know about them. cheers"

-Ability to allow only certain items into a chest.

-Auto sort machine as part of the advanced factory route, could be combined with a warehouse with upgradeable storage limits
-More energy sources, Battery Powered vehicles, rechargeable battery cells that turbine or solar cell can charge, maybe even steam powered steampunk retro vehicles , biogas generators that produce liquid fertilizer and energy both with proper care After typing this seems like a long list of ideas lol, but these are just some of the ideas I've had while playing and progressing through only to find a pretty giant hole in progression for agriculture compared to other professions.

Its awesome.  I just wanted u guys to know for farming with the soil sampler its a great tool, was trying to build some fireweed farms and other farms higher in the air, and on top of each other a few stories (ie with skyscraper floors) and currently dirt blocks are added for all the blocks beneath it, so it  wont let me plant well even though im there- unless i completely fill the blocks from ground level up to the intended height with dirt, in the 5x5 plot around it.  Is it possible if we could change this so the blocks get their info from  the 5x5 in the plane around it at the same height level? That would allow people to make better plots and fix that bug at the same time/so plants can still be planted at differing heights, like in hydroponics farms etc in a building that has multiple floors. Also I had an idea for fishing- you could have different tier fishing rods and baits, as well as lures, and traps that could work well with boats and fish in different areas and caught better at different locations and times of day, rain, storms, etc.  More weather additions to the game would be cool. Thanks guys!  This game is great"

I have been playing for several weeks on a KatherineOfSky community server (3 iterations). As we had pretty much different experiences some of points should be looked at. I was focusing on woodworks but still did participate in much other stuff around. ShaydenMac might remember the Sacred Grove Tree house she visited on a live stream. Everything below is my personal opinion. Don't get me wrong the game itself is pretty awesome. This post is here mostly to summarize issues I have encountered and make a suggestions to fix them and make the game even better. Inventory management
This is most used part in the game so being convenient is a must here.
I do like the idea of linked inventories however there are some issues here. Skills and balance
As I have said I mained woodworking. Here lies my main experience. However I have touched many more skills as well to understand the balance. Other general issues Oh man enough for today. Took too much time already."

The fabrication of deeds, physical paper ballots (in game) for voting, using paper to make books (including skill books), and perhaps other things like origami for more decorative items certainly seems like a possibility.  The devs certainly seem like they've had various plans for paper that at the moment don't seem to be implemented and some failed experiments in the past that they may want to get into in the future.  If it has those separate uses, its appearance as a separate skill distinct from other carpenter skills makes sense.  In its current state though, I agree that it does far too little to be justified. Inventory management is something that while it looks bad, compared to what was around in the past the current system is a huge improvement.  I wish there was more consistency between storage compartments, particularly with stockpiles and carts in terms of the number of items contained in each ""slot"".  Breaking up dirt and sand into groups of 5 and then being forced to recombine them when pulling them out of storage seems to be far too much work.  A much larger problem that I find though is when you get too many storage containers in one spot, there is a huge lag on both the server and on the client.  That in general it needs some attention and TLC I would agree. There are more things I could add here, but like you pointed out this is a comprehensive list of things you've found and have irritated you in terms of your gameplay.  Much of it I even agree with, so thank you for making this post."

ideas-feedback,ECO Season 1 - post mortem | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4585/eco-season-1-post-mortem,827,4,1,vsbmeza4,"Before I get into the grit of it, let me take a moment to say ECO is a great game with a good concept. About 12 of us got together and coexisted on a server and both saved and doomed our world (we were curious to see all endings). In an effort to make the full release of this game as amazing as it possible could be, we all worked on this write-up to list out things we would like to see changed and implemented into the game. Our ECO experience was fun, but we want to make it even better. We finished on version 7.3.2, so some of the things outlined here may be irrelevant by now. Inventory management.
Sorting and organization is a must and ECO’s system is not exactly user friendly. When accessing a chest, stockpile, or whatever it may be, other linked storage areas in a close proximity are also listed in no particular order. This makes it difficult to find what you’re looking for. Them being listed in order of proximity, how full they are, or player-given name would be a definite improvement.
On that same line, if the player reorders the storage areas in the menu, the storage list should stay in that order until the player moves them again. It should not reset when the menu is closed.
When a player is re-organising items from the opened inventory to multiple linked inventories, it would be nice for the inventory they initially accessed to always be shown on the menu – pin it to the top so when they’re scrolling between various storage areas, they can easily drag and drop from one place to the other without needing to constantly scroll between the two storages.
Items that do not have storage, such as a door, should not have the storage option on their menu screen.
Linked inventories needed to be unlinked from every storage area connected to it. It should be automatically unlinked from everything with one click. On the same note, if I disconnect the current inventory from a remote one, the link should be severed from the other direction too. Whitelisting
When you change the security on a chest/door/etc, it, by default, changes the security of your claim (due to the “inherit” setting). This is very confusing to the first-time player, and is very rarely the intent to do so. Instead, changing your claim’s permissions should be accessed only through the deed itself. Bugs we’ve encountered Claims and building
Connecting deeds has been a pain of ours. We weren’t looking to make different areas when expanding our base. It would be lovely to have a new claim connect to the deed it’s been placed adjacent to. If it’s not surrounded by any other claims, it could have a new deed. But if land that is directly connected to another claim is claimed, it should automatically belong to the existing claim. Building, though fun, needs some work. The default block shape does not fully connect to the thinner walls. If a default block (or any other block that is not a wall), is placed on the same y-level as a different block, it will not connect on the longer side. For example, the second story of a house will always have a gap between the floor and walls, if the floor is a 1x1 block and the walls are the .5x1 shape. As a builder, this was very annoying and made it difficult to design around the gaps. The same can be said for roofing.
Roofing was very difficult to place if you didn’t know how it connected to another roof block. The bottom of the roof blocks should be the same tone and texture as the side of the default blocks.
It is very annoying to see the darker toned-roofs outline the ceiling.
It would be nice to be able to change the color of, or paint the building materials. The ghost block of the item to be placed has been difficult to get used to. At times we were unable to distinguish between what’s already placed and what we are about to place down. De-saturating the ghost block a bit more and making it more transparent could go a long way. Building materials are very limited especially when you’re a builder in other games. Having vastly different textures for different building types would be great. I would build my sheds and workshops out of logs if I could, but machines need higher tier materials, so each of my buildings - no matter the use - look all the same. That’s no fun. We felt that we had no other incentive to have a house other than to gather skill points. And as tricky the rooms are to build, they yield little to no emotional reward. Finding a use for the house would add greatly to the game. More decorative items, a fridge to counter food spoil times, the need/option to sleep, allow usage of the chairs, beds, bathroom items. Add decorative items that don’t interfere with the housing points, like paintings, flowers, candles, plates, cutlery, etc to allow people to add their own personal touch to houses, so all building’s don’t look the same inside. Game content
We are aware the game is in beta and not fully released.
Below are options we believe could help create a more immersive experience by modifying existing options We’ve also devised some ideas around skillsets: Automation
Automation is key and should be added for later-game content for carpenters, builders, metal workers, etc. Things like conveyor belts, minecarts, and lumber processing to ease the grind of transportation. End game
We were all looking forward to this and made a mad rush to be able to save and doom our world. The “destroy the meteor” option was lack-luster. The animation was very cool, but the reward did not add up to the work we did to save our planet. All we got was a congratulations message. Maybe give us something in-game as a reward, such as additional skill points or a novelty item.
The animation for the doomsday ending was AMAZING, but the meteor landed where none of us expected – we saw it falling in a trajectory that suggested it would destroy the area in front of us, but it landed a couple hundred meters next to us. - https://www.twitch.tv/videos/259807667 Add the meteor chunks when that land on the earth: We went exploring and only found holes. It would have been cool to see the meteor and larger space rocks strewn about the land. We were all very surprised when the meteor didn’t kill us or the planet. Sure, there were gaping holes and the radiation did kill a lot, but it wasn’t lasting. We could still play the game and survive after the impact. Maybe change this so the world continues to decay until it completely dies? Overall
Despite everything listed, we were happy with our ECO experience and can’t wait to see what the devs have in store. The graphics were wonderful, the in-game sounds were delightful (though more bird calls would be nice to hear), and the world actually felt alive. It has the making of a fun and relaxing game, and with some improvement, it can be amazing. We will be doing a Season 2 once there's more mid-game content to explore. We're all really looking forward to the already announced plans and can't wait to play more!"

The carpenter could build bigger carts only movable by Horses and furniture for a horsestable. Choosing the Hunter profession would be more appealing by adding a domestication speciality to tame horses and breed them (maybe even other animals).  A horsestable could function as a additional room to gather skill points. And the best part is, that they do not cause pollution but on the other hand need alot of food."

This would allow to go much deeper with the meteor dilemma. Let`s say we have five different meteor sizes to choose from: Diameter* Each diameter sets specific pre - and post impact challenges for the game. e.g: If >= 400m size was set, two and more anti meteor weapons are required to destroy the meteor successfully. If meteor was not destroyed in time and hits the surface, depending on meteor size a part of the planet is burned and a crater appears (the player may find gold, iron and rare materiales here later?).  Instead if the meteor hits the water surface a tsunami will arise (strength / size depends on meteor size). If this is not enough an ice-age could occur afterwards with less sun and the timespan depends on meteor size again and shouldn't occur for an smaller meteor. If >= 1000m - Game over? or like the 400m meteor just more badass. Also consider if just 2 anti meteor weapons are ready (of required e.g 5 for this size), when time elapsed the meteor could break apart (randomly) into more pieces....some may miss the planet.... Optional:
The visual ingame appearance of the meteor depends on its size. The diameter is not visible to the players. A new devices can be researched and built to measure the meteor and give the information what is needed to defeat it and the impact it may have to the planet if that fails. And yes, i didn't play or own the game myself .....yet. Just watched some short vids without to much spoilers ;-) *Diameter values take from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_event"

Yes, the game is already hard, but I think adding a medical field would be interesting. You could have more time spent in pollution, the more calories you spend. You don't die in this game, so I thought that increasing the amount of calories spent would be an option. There could be a new workbench, Apothecary, that makes medicine from herbs and there could be doctors and nurses. There could be random diseases that come from nowhere that increases amount of calories used. This may be a bit too much, but in my opinion, this would make the game more fun and challenging."

More specifically these actions should be possible: This allows for sharing data between laws and government systems One big application I could see for this is that you could create user groups / permission systems. For example you can use the system to make someone a part of the government (police for example), giving them access to certain laws (numeric comparison) Here is a concrete example on how I would use this proposed system (plus enact-able laws):
An enact-able law is setup that only the mayor / president can use. This law is used to promote another player to police officer by setting a police officer variable to ""1"" or boolean true
Then a law that checks if youre allowed to build or destroy blocks checks if the player is on own property or if the player is a police officer. The same could be done for many systems."

ideas-feedback,The new housing skill system vs freedom of creativity | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4518/the-new-housing-skill-system-vs-freedom-of-creativity,1212,7,1,_Viper,"The problem The new housing skill system is definitely an improvement over the old one. It's easier to understand (the old one was not very transparent) and it forces you to produce higher tier building materials, which in turn puts a bigger dent in the world's eco system through resources needed and pollution created. This is definitely a welcome change in my opinion. It does, however, ruin a different and important aspect of the game: The ability to choose what your house looks like - what it’s built from - as you're now forced to upgrade to higher tier building materials to increase your housing skill bonus. Basically these two systems are mutually exclusive. The question is: How do we maintain the gameplay impact of the housing skill system change in 7.0.0, but bring back the freedom to choose how your house looks - what it’s built from? The possible solution I believe I've found a good solution for doing this, but I am putting this here to hear what people think, as well as making SLG aware. It might even spark an even better solution from someone else. I went through a good few ideas (none of which were really any good) until I landed on this one. A (4 actually) new building block type is introduced. You use this to build your house like you would with any of the current building block types. The difference is that this is a tier building block type, which allows you to build any block material type (ie. bricks or glass) that you have currently unlocked.
This new block type is created from already made building block types. So for instance to get a tier 2 type block you would craft it from bricks (or another tier 2 material block). A tier 2 block type allows you to build tier 1 and 2 building block types (that you have unlocked).
You would select the type of material you want to build, by selecting it in a manner much like the current building block types (window, wall, stairs, column etc.), allowing you to create a tier 2 hewn log room, if you want. This gives people back the freedom to have their house look like they want, while maintaining the new housing skill system and its progression. I imagine that crafting these new blocks won’t take a lot of time, but probably require an extra ingredient or not be a 1:1 ratio conversion. This is a balancing issue that I’ll leave up to SLG, if they choose to implement this solution. Put in another way: A potential issue One thing that is of concern with this is that you can basically create bricks from lumber, for instance. Since both are tier 2 materials, it'd mean that you could get bricks by creating this new building block type out of lumber. One solution to this could be that if you want to create this type of building block from lumber, it would also require a brick to do. Of course for this example tier 2 has other tier 2 material types, so this would again be a balancing issue across the tiers.
This has the interesting side effect that to do this you're more reliant on each other, assuming the person making the lumber doesn't already have the ability to also make bricks. This opens up for another trade venue and transportation requirements. In closing I hope this makes sense, if not let me know and I will try to clarify! :)"

More materials at the top tier would permit at least greater variety and wouldn't require a massive new system of transforming blocks from one type to another or even trying to distinguish between a Tier 4 Hewn Log vs. Tier 1 Hewn Log. I know that you are suggesting that other materials including things like stone roads (it can be an attractive material when used in accents) can be used for housing construction.  The idea of building material tiers being used to calculate house score is something that forces design rather than the original system of a requirement for x number of blocks to use various manufacturing tables in the game permitted a greater degree of freedom in room design.  Rooms & buildings now lack those accents and details like I used to be able to incorporate into a room design."

I mean, it is, but the point of this is to create the freedom to create a house with the look you want, no matter what tier the material might be. Your suggestion still won't allow someone to build a tier 4 mortared stone house, for instance. More material variety through the tiers (especially 3 and 4) would without a doubt be nice, but this suggestion stands as trying to solve the actual problem of having the freedom we had before."

It also looks like the Viewer may be attempting to keep values updated in real time which would explain some of the lag.

Watching KatherineOfSky youtube and experiencing stuff myself in solo play I do see that any kind of timelapse is really missing from the game. At some point the time it takes to accumulate required materials and skillpoints is just too big and you have to just afk for some time just to wait things finish. Another problem we see is with lights. It is just too damn dark around and using fuel in all kinds of torches is just too expensive. So it makes sense to use beds to sleep until morning with timelapsed simulation. We are solving two tasks - the desperate need for lights AND time to finish up production and get those skillpoints. Cause it is not fun to afk grind stuff.
Sure thing servers won't do that as you have to remain competetive and fair for everyone. But you can still use a bed for graceful logoff which will let a player accumulate skillpoints at higher rate compared to logoff at a random position."

As for tailings having a half-life... they don't. In real life they don't, unless you let the weather get to them and let them spread their toxic stuff everything. In real life tailing contain metals which do not have a half life because they don't break down. A ton of soil with lead it will still have the lead in it a million years from now. I have put in the ideas about Stabilizing the waste so it won't leak into the environment, which is what actually happens in real life but you still have to put it in a specialized landfill that has special lining so you can collect the rain water and make sure that no toxic stuff is getting into the ground water. But yes, in real life tanning, baking, glass making, etc, also make hazardous materials, but as they haven't added the Trash add on yet, give it time. If you are smart with your planning you can get through the whole game with only ever making about 12 tailings, which shouldn't be too hard to deal with. Personally I put my smith inside the mine to allow resource transport to be easier which also made finding a spot for tailing super easy as well. Just used a branch of the mine shaft. I really hope they do add the hazardous waste to the other jobs and do enjoy that the hazardous waste doesn't go anywhere, because that is what happens in real life, your trash doesn't despawn after a day and it would be good to teach people how much normal things actually produce hazardous waste."

ideas-feedback,Single player pause/save game | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4413/single-player-pause-save-game,490,1,1,Pacifyer,"Hello, I just bought Eco after watching some great vids on Youtube.
I started playing but after a single several hour session I noticed several annoying things about how the game actually works. The first thing I was annoyed with is absence of PAUSE feature. While there are no dangers in the world of Eco for a player right now it seams obvious to be able to pause the game if you want to go afk for some time. Even in multiplayer game PAUSE seams like an obvious addition in the game that kinda pushes you in the back by a ticking asteroid timer. The second one kinda costed me quite some nerves. You just don't have a simple SAVE button nowhere in the game... Just Disconnect and Quit... Now that is embarassing... I would understand if the game had SAVE AND QUIT button like Minecraft does but in its current state I just don't get it. I do understand that even in solo play mode game runs a server in the background and the client joins it. But that should be much more clear for a player. Besides I would really like to have control of savegames. I do understand that a player should experience the consequences of his actions without a way to roll them back but this is a really bad approach in the gaming IMO. This is a dev choice but still I would like to see server settings about autosave interval or clearly explained rules about this. By trial and error I did figure out that simple QUIT will power server down and save your world. But this should be much more clear for a single player mode. I am not saying about total absence of in-game information about setting up your own standalone server."
ideas-feedback,Servers | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4117/servers,1302,5,1,The-Ghost,"I really think that Strange Loop Games needs to run the servers for this game
The reason being is that I have been on a couple of servers already and
I am getting any where from a 500 to 700 ms latency. And before you try and blame the issue with my connection there is
no issues with my connection I am on a high speed connection and
doing speed tests and pulling like 3 - 5 MB / S my connection is fast. I also work in the computer industry and I am a trained Network admin
as well and know that there could be an issue with the route that
is being taken from my ISP to the server so i did a trace route
to the server and there was no issues up to the server. I think there are some of these servers which are being hosted
on poor connections and sub standard equipment which is
causing these issues. Also I don't believe that it is fair that simply because you may want
to do one thing and the person that runs the server wants you
to do something else so they ban you and you lose everything. I have run across that as well some of these ""admins"" and I use
that term loosely have no clue on how to properly deal with people
or run a server. I believe that the servers should be run by Strange Loop Games and
a professional staff that knows what they are doing. Fine you want to run your own server that is fine but the main servers
for this game should be run by  Strange Loop games and we should not
have to rely on others who have little to no knowledge on how to run
a server properly. Also with all of these small servers the population is WAY too small
where you are getting one or two people on and no one to interact
with. Please setup your own servers Strange Loop Games and professionally
host and run them."

I do understand your opinion tho, I have been running various servers across games for about the last 12 years ish.

ideas-feedback,Server List problems | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4383/server-list-problems,687,4,1,Xephita,"I posted pretty much the same over on the steam forums, but I rarely see any dev replies over there in suggestions and not sure how much anyone looks at it. I know it's been mentioned before in different ways. I'm not sure how the game has been in dev for so long and still has a server list like this. Here's my post: Server list still needs serious improvements
Still no sort function other than the default ms, which is awful because it just causes the server list to jump about. The search function isn't really very useful either. Most servers under the 'public' list are passworded, there's no way to see if a server is passworded before you try to join (most games have a padlock icon). Which then means you have to go back to the server list and wait for it to jump around for 5 mins before it's vaguely useable once again. The 'stop' function help's a bit with this but it's not ideal. Servers that aren't passworded half the time fail to connect, it's not just me my friend has the same issue as well. We go to play ECO, want to join a public server, ideally in the first few days - which narrows down the options a lot. Having no sort function by either users, users online or day is a really inconvienient thing. Usually after about 10-15 mins of trying to find newer servers, going through a load that are passworded or fail to connect for whatever reason (show incompatible servers isn't ticked) we give up and play something else. I do not understand how ECO has such a bad server list with so little functionality. Games like Quake and UT had better more user friendly lists 15 years ago. You can't even highlight a server and have it keep place in the list. We end up having to quickly favourite a few just to look at the details. Yes I understand totally we can both host our own server / play by ourselves but that isn't really the idea behind the game and we'd rather join a newer server online. It can't just be us that feels this way, I've seen a lot of other posts about the server list. I can't understand why it still hasn't been fixed. Its like the dev's have never actually tried finding and joining an online server. I don't mean to come off as rude, but this is currently the number one factor that prevents us playing. Once you find a server it's all good, but with a more limited playtime (both have families) this is quite a big negative experience."

I'd estimate typically 7 people online during progression and twice that at its peak.  I joined the server on the 2nd day, where most people had pretty good mortared stone structures and played through till the laser was constructed. I understand that the game is a work in progress and some of these items will be resolved in time, but I am going to list them all for completeness.  What I am not going to focus on are bugs, as we all know they exist and need to be fixed eventually. I'll just go through this in chronological order of my thoughts while playing: Would have liked to see the government system but apparently it was jacked up and kept crashing the server, so didn't get to see ay of that.

Once you get to powered carts, grass and dirt roads have a -20% speed debuff to them (and I'd imagine this also applies to excavators and the planned vehicles) so it's actually a 40% buff for stone roads and a 70% buff for asphalt roads."
ideas-feedback,First Playthough Feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4378/first-playthough-feedback,785,4,3,JohnK,"Good feedback, and some good points on balancing. The last point, nothing to do after youve established your profession, curious why you weren't incentivized enough to get another specialty, or upgrade specialties? The ideas is that each branch of the skill tree will need steady progression and advanvcement. Toll roads is great we'll definitely do that. I want to make laws for new players as well, that they can get things from the government decided by laws. Server browser update is in progress now."
ideas-feedback,First Playthough Feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4378/first-playthough-feedback,785,4,4,CookieBreath,"The short version is that I didn't have the skill points to compete with people who had selected the new skills.  The new specialties were very expensive SP-wise and as I mentioned before, if you're not on par with your efficiency skill, that means there's no way you'll be competitive in the market (making the skill essentially worthless).  Going over the route I chose: Smith/Smelting/Metalworking 4 first because no one would sell me a blast furnace.  36 points Smith/Advanced Smelting/Casting 4 & Efficiency 3 before I realized it wasn't going to make me any money.  135 points Smith/Advanced Smelting/Alloy Smelting 2 (3 & 4 do nothing) & Efficiency 5 & Speed 5.  This was my next best bet as I only had one competitor here, and while he was ahead of me, there was only one person to fight for it.   Probably should have stayed away from speed to keep an extra 50.  215 points. By the time I had maxed out the alloy tree, people had already picked up oil/electricity/industry and I just really didn't have the skill points to catch up in a reasonable amount of time.  I had already struggled to catch up with alloys and made enough money for a half decent house.  I decided to go with Smith/Advanced Smelting/Steelworking 4 & Efficiency 5 as the only competitor had only 3 in efficiency. 260 points.  This didn't pan out for me as well because most people had either bought lights by the time I got there or had stopped playing. That's 646 points total and we were basically done on day 12 for an average of 53 points per day.  I also missed a day or two which didn't help.  Essentially at the beginning of the game I had a pretty small house and meh diet, making upper 40s or mid 50s per day.  Once I finished alloys I had moved up to about 70, and with my lights installed I'm at 90ish.  One person on the server has a house that by itself gives him 86 points per day, though most are around 40.  I could do better on the house now but don't see the point."
ideas-feedback,Stockpile transfers - Exploit or Legit? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4323/stockpile-transfers-exploit-or-legit,2060,7,1,Achlys1775,"One thing we do on our server is create a chain of stockpiles, sometimes 20 or so in a row, across the map, to quickly move items from A to B.  We will place stockpiles at max distance so that when you look under the storage tab you only see three stockpiles, and then transfer materials from one to the next.  For example, in a chain of stockpiles 1 through 10, rather than picking up every item by hand, or putting it in a cart, we'd access stockpile 2, and move everything from 1 to 3.  Then we'd go to 4, and move everything from 3 to 5... and so on until we've moved an entire stockpile a quarter way around the globe. While it's a great thing, it feels like an exploit and, in a game where the developers are focused on ensuring players manage externalities, this system is a quick and calorie free way to move heavy stuff long distances, far quicker than you could have, even if you'd used a cart.  Granted, if this is what the developer wants, so be it, but personally, I like games to be has realistic as possible and this isn't. Perhaps a fix would be prohibiting stockpiles and chests from recognizing other storage devices.  Or, if that wouldn't work, stop players from using the storage tab to transfer items from one box to another... they could SEE what's available, but they couldn't specifically move it."
ideas-feedback,Stockpile transfers - Exploit or Legit? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4323/stockpile-transfers-exploit-or-legit,2060,7,2,Thineboot,"While you're right, you can use this as an exploit, deactivating movement between storage devices would do much more harm.
Stockpiles and chests have a very limited range. That said it's hard enough to manage an industrial area to minimize dragging intermediate goods around. If you would have to pick up 7 ingots a time and walk it to the next chest you'd stop playing. Wooden carts are slow and handling is critical at ramps or corners. Not to mention powered carts. Without proper tools you have to be creative like dragging 25 stacks multiple times. Digging a tunnel is a pain in the ass and while I haven't done it by myself I've come up with a similar idea to use a cart and stockpiles to help our chain gang ;) Or make use of stockpiles for a deep mine - now there are elevators introduced. Simple rails and mine carts were used since the 16th century - Eco has none of the yet. When the tools are available less exploits will be used. At least I hope so.
Nonetheless you should post it at EcoIssues. Maybe they need a reason to start implementing more tools ;)"

It's a side effect of linked inventories and removing the ability to transfer between inventories will hurt the game more than this 'exploit' does. Besides I'd still rather use a truck once they're released. I hate moving full stockpiles around, it feels like I'm getting carpal tunnel when I do it. As efficient as it is I can't imagine how much I'd hate moving full stockpiles down a line of 20 across the world. Haha"

Right now when moving stuff from one stockpile to an other you have to click, scroll and drag the Items to where you want. And you can only move like a stack of 5 dirt at once. Still you are able to carry 10 of it with your shovel. Instead of all the scrolling and perfectly aiming with the mouse (which appears to be kinda hard, because when being just a little off you have to do it again). think its easier to just carry it if its just a few stockpiles away. For longer distances using the cart is fine too. I would agree on it being an exploit when you would have a simple way to move your items around that would just take seconds to move one stockpile to an other. But thats not possible as far as I can see. But what I would like tho is that when my Research table can reach to one stockpile, that It could also reach all attached stockpiles. Right now I am pretty organized and have one stockpile for stone, one for bricks, one for wood, and one for ores. But none of my tables is able to reach every other stockpile which makes it quite annoying moving items around. Especially since you have to click and drag the Items onto your carry slot. As it seems stockpiles can have linked inventories but they dont really seem to use them. Or I just havent figured out how. I mean when a research table need stone and the stockpile knows where to get it... why not getting it? Is there a neat key combination to get an items to your carry slot faster?"
ideas-feedback,Stockpile transfers - Exploit or Legit? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4323/stockpile-transfers-exploit-or-legit,2060,7,6,Thineboot,"You can move all linked inventory up and down - except powered vehicles (two lines :().
This way you can move output storage on top and input storage below. Linking is necessary.
You can drag a stack from one storage into another without using your carry/inventory. If you're playing solo you can modify the range of any storage.
In [Path]\Eco\Eco_Data\Server\Mods\Objects\StockpileObject.cs you could increase LinkComponent for instance. I won't give you a full and complete list, just explore the files if that's fine for you. Keep in mind that the farther an item can reach the more Eco has to calculate. For solo this may be fine but as soon as you start playing with others that's not working anymore."

ideas-feedback,The deed system | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4264/the-deed-system,1120,5,1,Skossis,"Hello, First of all. Thanks for having me, this game is great and has huge potential. I wanna touch on the deed system and give my two cents on it. Perhaps you can share you ideas and thoughts about it too. So. First of all. I don't see a need to have a deed system at all. I think that on every building/vehicle/object there should be a button called ""access"" for example. Here you can set the desired authorisation for certain player on the object. This would eliminate the need of having the deeds stored in your backpack or chests, they simply wouldn't exists because everything will be handled inside each object. This touches on my next point.  Instead of a deed system there should be some kind of party system instead (call it what ever you want). Everyone have the ability to create a party and invite other players to their party. This is done via an in-game GUI (accessed by the ""P"" shortcut on your keyboard?). Once you're in a party with someone you automatically have access to EVERYONES stuff who's in the party if that makes sense. This means that you don't ever have to deal with special authorisation at all. It'll be handled automatically. Although if need be, you can edit an object and remove someones authorisation so even if they're in your party they can't use the specified object Please let me know what you think about this idea. If you don't like it then I'd love to hear what you have to say! Thank you in advance for reading my thread!"
ideas-feedback,The deed system | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4264/the-deed-system,1120,5,2,Thineboot,"Besides that I have my issues with the actual deed-system: With a deed you can authorize someone while being on the other side of the world. So distance matter. @ Party-system: you can change auth to inherited. In fact most objects start with inherited.
Problem with inherited is that you have to be very careful when adding someone to your house-deed. That's why contract boards have a special deposit to prevent harm or at least try to minimize it.
I agree that it would be nice to have some Party-entries, too. It would be much easier to auth one or more parties than each player individually. Then there are vehicles which work not the same way. At the moment you have to add additional auth each time you place it in the world. Put your vehicle-deed in the vehicle and anyone can pick it up. That way ownership changes.
Could be changed by adding a button>>list in the deed-UI. My suggestion would be to have a Book of Deeds instead of multiple deeds which easily can spam your inventory in mid/late-game. Either in addition to the backpack or as a simple button (D?) which opens all your deeds and works like the backpack (B)."
ideas-feedback,The deed system | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4264/the-deed-system,1120,5,3,Skossis,I understand what you are saying but I still don't see the point of having the deed item itself.

ideas-feedback,The deed system | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4264/the-deed-system,1120,5,4,Thineboot,"When is a building a building? When there are rooms? In that case Eco would have to calculate before each and every action whether it's ok or not by checking for a room. How big can a room be? Is there a max-size? And who's the owner of a building? The one who sets the last stone to enclose a room? When there are two or more rooms belonging to more than one player? It's not that easy as it seems. But I'll listen...
A vehicle is a vehicle, that's simple.
Objects like tables and chests... So no claims? 'cause with claims you have to store them somewhere.
At the moment you have a deed for each property which consists of various claims (5x5).
What would you suggest instead? Objects either refer to the deed/claim (inherited) or are authorized individually.
You can call inherited party and authorized not authorized... there is not much difference.
Except that I also would like to see some defined Parties aka group of users instead of all or none or keep adding. Problem of playing without claims would be that anybody could change blocks around your house and you couldn't prevent it.
Objects only belong to you when they are placed (partially) on in claim. Same effect, they are save of being dug out or buried under a pile of dirt or whatever comes next. If you have claims you have to have a way to manage them. How would you unclaim a plot?"

I've bought Eco at SLG not only because the developer gets more money but it was cheaper, too.

My traps are WAY too deep. They are out in OPEN water and at the bottom of the water. If you are no the top of the water surface you can't reach the traps from there and you have
to dive down. The storage chest also would be out of range as well if I had it sitting on the surface on a pile

ideas-feedback,Pure Ideas and feedback in general | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4167/pure-ideas-and-feedback-in-general,389,2,1,Icy,"This feedback will be purely based on 20+ hours of gameplay outside of the offered servers 2 player co-op. First thing I will talk about has to do with bugs and glitches. It's probably known glitches that devs are working to fix but I thought I would give my opinion on them. Next thing I think needs to be improve is midgame. Now mind you I count midgame as you have iron, iron tools and you're pushing to industrialize your world. Im going to have to start from the very beggining of this. When you start you always have your stone tools, no issue, you start building a base, workbenches and all that stuff. But the fact that you get iron tools from upgrading skills destroys midgame. Since damaged/broken tools doesn't actually seem to be a lot more inefficient I never repair my tools, especially not since iron (atleast in my case) late midgame and expensive since I have to store all of the tailings (which I think there should be someway to remove the pollution from them after some time.)
This means that you basically start off with iron tools and keep them untill late game, even though they are broken.
Since iron is expensive you don't really want to waste it on repairing but instead industrializing your world. We basically go from beggining (setting up a house, mine, stable food and learning the game ect.) to midgame(grind for lategame) to lategame (industialize.) The only new thing midgame brings that I could thing of is building material and the cart, which doesn't make a huge impact to the gamplay. Midgame was just very boring in my case, it just mean't grinding for lategame. That was just quickly a bit of my thoughts and I know there is going to be someone telling me that it is only early access, and I know it is. This is just what I think the devs should prioritize a bit more.
Feel free to leave your questions/thoughts."

The re-spawn rate and system really should be changed or re-thought.  As an example i cleared an area and left 1 tree in 5 mins there was 5 saplings from that one tree so thought to my self its the tree. cut it down the saplings keep showing up.  seems to be related to static re-spawn points generated when the map is made so if you remove the stump a tree with re-spawn at that point even if no other trees are around for more then 50 away. re-pawns with destroy planted crops as well. this have a profound impact on farming as you can not  clear cut an area that has high yields as it will slowly whip out a large portion of your farm. This is an issue with plants mainly but the game as a entirety as it also effects animals and basically negates any activity players have in the early game aka you cant strip the environment of its resources then have to deal with that later. there will always be more. Rivers/Map The map generator is a mess bios are spotty and Rivers are more akin to Canyons then rivers why are most rivers 5-8 tiles down to water then another 5-8 tiles deep? anyone? other things -water wheels in the air?
-water does not flow? ( cant re direct a river)
-salt/fresh Water influence ( i filled a ""salt river"" in a desert in completely with dirt and no change to the "" salt water influence area"" again dealing with static information on world generation and players unable to actually effect the environment.)
-to much wild food ( see re-spawns )
-needs a much deeper skill tree and pre-required items ie basic eng is needed to even use mechanical not just buying a scroll )
-farming over crowding needs to be addressed the entire point of farming is to allow desired plants in a small area."

Tomatoes used to be 24 hours and rest was 4 hours roughly. Now everything being equal for the most part, I like it. I plant a 10x10 for each plant I want to grow and I usually get about 75%+ of that back in harvest with about 500+ turnout so it works with the time trade off. I guess I'd be more inclined to want the nutrients to maybe supplement the growth time a bit more, but I haven't played with nutrients enough yet to say if they do or not"

my Husband and his Brother also play, we have our own server so we tweaked the skill points a little to learn things faster.

A search box for your inventory when opening linked machies, benches, chests etc. Ability to rename chests once they are placed. Ways to save your password on the login screen.

This keeps the workbench logic as it is now:
Put any output in the first storage that accepts it. (Like ""hewn logs"" wont go in a chest even if its on top because they dont fit there) With a filter on a stockpile you would just have to check if the first accepts ""hewn logs"" then the second etc until you find the first that takes them.

ideas-feedback,Housing items | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4140/housing-items,526,2,1,Kiwi,"The current system of housing items is not working well. Currently, the first item gives full value, the second gives 75%, the third 56%, fourth 42%, and so on. It doesn't matter what the items are. The problem with this is that the order in which you place items is important. Placing a 2-point item in a room of 1-point ones will give less if it is placed third instead of first. And even if you do place it in the correct order, sometimes it will randomly change. When looking this up, I came across information that said the 75% decrease was applied to item types, so having two chairs would not be as good as a table and a chair. This was obviously changed sometime and I think it should change back. Also on the subject of housing values, the balanced house multiplier breaks the whole system. There are times where placing a new item will decrease your overall score, significantly. This should never happen. If I spend resources I should get a benefit for it.
My suggestion to fix this, and still take balanced houses into consideration, would be to change the amount of points given by an item in relation to the current score of the room relative to the other rooms in the house. The lowest value room should give the full value for the item."

I was thinking the other day while playing the game if there was a way to leave a message to the fellow citizens that weren't connected at the moment to inform them that we had a new community chest in the city center. I then realised my only option was to use a wooden sign, but seeing how it might end up taking a lot of space, I would love to see a general billbord that would work a bit like the contract board but that just receives messages/announcement. On the same note, but less crucial to the game, I'd love to see a posting system. We could build a mailbox and people could (using paper) write a message and leave it in your mailbox for more private messaging while unconnected. (We could have a postman in our town to deliver letters! :O) As I said, this last one is less ""core"" to the game and more ""futile fun"" but it was an idea I had. This way, we could cover the problem of offline messaging since right now the only way to talk to other player is to catch them while they are connected or use an external tool (forums or discord). Which isn't so bad it means I'll stop playing if it doesnt happen, it would just really help the immersion and give a nice fix (I don't think it would be too hard to create a billboard system; for the letters it might be different, I don't know.) Oh a last thing: Will there ever be breeding incorporated in the game ? I know the animals are mostly wild ones, but it would be nice to have a way to boost the population of some animals when they are too low instead of just waiting and hoping they do the do before dying. (For exemple we started out with 2 tortoise and they both died after 3 days without bearing a single baby :( ) Maybe not have a farming system as a whole (like sheeps and cows) but a way for the players to help repopulate animals like they kind of can with the trees and the plants. (Like set up the food the animals like around were they are could help the local population grow). I don't know. Not the best fix but a fix. Thanks for the game guys !"

Then again I say that and I have no idea how the game works so maybe these are really big changes. I just think that they would all benefit the players and add a new layer to the farmer's role :) (you could be a land farmer or an animal herder.

Trading based on barter is wonderful, but complex. It is difficult to choose prices. That's why I created a tool (php) that gives the price of each item according to its recipe. It is enough to inform the price of the natural elements and the rest is coherent. Others will surely make such small applications. And you will probably change settings and add items.

that a person doesn't have unlimited breath. You should put some kind of breath bar
where a person can only stay under water for so long before they have to surface or die. Right now I was under water for 5 min or more with absolutely no consequences. I think that this is something that the eco developers need to look at. An average person can probably only hold there breath for a few minutes before
having to surface. Can some one please look into putting something like this into Eco to make
it more realistic so that you can't just stay under water forever harvesting clams, urchins

I've been at this for a while now, and can't figure out how to do this, which led me here to offer some more general suggestions than the problem above. 1: Allow Law Conditions to be based on species population. I.e.: Prevent harvest of species X if the population is below [constant]
1.1: ... if the population is declining by [trend]
2: Add ""Planting"" as an action condition to the law system

And I only did that parttime, as I was focused a lot on minting and other smelting things.
4 Stone out of one Rock is way too much and irradicates the need for bigger machines. This is true for pretty much every X for 1 block in the game. -impact is too small for small servers.
a group of 10 players with a mild sense of pollutionreduction doesnt even create 1/500th of what the earth can reduce again.
Everything that burns coal/oil/wood should emit pollution depending on how fast it burns through the coal. -Fishing is useless. The rod 100% the fishingtrap 50%
Why should i cook and prepare fish, when meat gives better values in every sense and animals aren't ever in need of extinction, since farms produce WAY TOO MUCH -general balance
while i spoke about mining and building, a general balance would be appreciated. We have about 3000 corn a day from one farmer. Thats enough for a lifetime. And all this without any machines. Just reduce the yield, force a bigger spread of crops and make it harder to make the right fertilizer."

As far as 'smoothing' terrain I'm not sure how well that would work in game. It uses voxels like minecraft. You'd probably have to place blocks, which are already in game (stairs and ramps).

I think it should probably be renamed as such and then have an actual bulldozer a little later in game alongside the excavator for larger scale work that would be able to break stone. Maybe the skid steer could ‘work’ 2 or 3 tiles wide at once and the bulldozer could do 4 or 6. Also really wish you guys would make these construction vehicles tracked. While, granted, there are wheeled skid steers, most construction equipment used in this capacity is tracked. It’s more stable, allows for greater mobility on an often uneven and debris laden construction site, and gives the machine more grip/traction to perform high torque jobs. I think y’all should seriously consider changing the excavator, grinder, and a future big bulldozer to tracks rather than wheels and allow them to drive over 1 block inclines either up or down. It’s also worth considering making the skid steer tracked, or having both a wheeled and tracked version. If you’re looking for ways to balance this, an easy balance would be to code it so that if you drive a tracked vehicle over a road it damages/destroys it and have it trample grass/bushes/crops down to dirt. It’s common knowledge that tracked vehicles are very destructive on the environment upon which they’re driving, and would definitely tear up a dirt or stone road. Perhaps asphalt roads could be immune to track damage, which would give a further incentive to build them. Now for further suggestions: -Change the way basic task skills are handled. As it stands, each basic task has its own specialization (digging, logging, mining, gathering, and hunting). That's 5 ""specializations"" to take to perform basic tasks without destroying your calorie count every time you need a few stacks of wood or to flatten an area for construction. This obviously increases the cost of future specializations into your ACTUAL 'career' as it counts towards your overall specs. I believe that all of these should be lumped into 1 specialization under the survivalist tree ""Self-Sufficiency"". All 5 of those skill trees should be lumped into there in somewhat modified groupings. My idea for this would be as follows. Self-Sufficiency: Unlocks Digging, Logging, Mining, Archery, Gathering, and Fishing in 6 trees.
Digging: Shovel Efficiency -> Shovel Durability
Logging: Logging Efficiency -> Logging Damage -> Axe Durability
Mining: Mining Efficiency -> Pickaxe Durability
Archery: Bow Efficiency -> Bow Damage
Gathering: Scythe Efficiency -> Scythe Durability -> Basic Gathering
Fishing: Fishing Rod Efficiency -> Fishing Rod Durability New/Changed Skills:
-Durability, increases # of actions a tool can withstand by 10% per level, maximum of 50%
-Basic Gathering, increases # of plants gained by gathering by 1 per level up to 5 (All existing gathering skills lumped into 1 skill). Plants no longer give seeds unless the player has a new skill outlined below, Herbalism.
-Fishing, the ability to clean fish or shuck claims will be moved to the cooking tree, the above fishing skills only allows you to build a fishery, a fishing rod, and fish traps at the same levels as currently exist. Farming would have an additional tree added to it:
Herbalism -> Botany New Skills:
-Herbalism, increases the # of seeds obtained thru gathering of wild plants by 1 per level
-Botany, Allows the dissection of plants to gain a basic understanding of what it needs to thrive. Each level grants an additional layer of data.
--Level 1, Dissection/Examination shows preferred temperature range.
--Level 2, Dissection/Examination shows preferred moisture range.
--Level 3, Increases accuracy of botanical examination results by 25%
--Level 4, Increases accuracy of botanical examination results by 50%
--Level 5, Increases yield of farmed plants by 50% Botany Explained:
At levels 1 & 2, the player can take plants to the farm table and perform a task ""example <plant>"". By default, the results are 50% accurate, meaning at level 2, a player could examine a beet and find that it prefers temperatures between 7 and 13, moisture between 15% and 50%. At level 3, the range would decrease and become more accurate. For example, Temperature between 8.5 and 11.5. At level 4 it gives you exact numbers for what the plant will grow optimally at. The skill to clean fish, clams, urchins, and kelp as well as their efficiency and speed skills would be moved into Butchery under their own tree:
Fish Cleaning -> Fish Cleaning Efficiency -> Fish Cleaning Speed"

-Jackhammer/Pneumatic Drill - Handheld powertool to work as an intermediary between the pickaxe and grinding machine. Consumes less calories and breaks rock faster/more efficiently. This tool always breaks rocks into chunks of 4, never creating the block of rock/ore that requires a second hit to break. Can hold the left mouse button to continually break rock where the cursor is pointing. (Requires a compressor or generator within an arbitrary distance to work.) -Pneumatic Shovel - Handheld powertool to work as an intermediary between the shovel and the upcoming bulldozer/skid steer. Quickly collects dirt while the left mouse button is held down into a stack of 10 in the player's inventory. (Requires a compressor or generator within an arbitrary distance to work) -Chainsaw - Handheld powertool to work as an advancement of the hatchet. Consumes less calories and cuts down trees much faster, allowing more precise cuts. Also cuts off branches with ease. (Must be fueled with gasoline, perhaps implementing a mechanic where right clicking a barrel of gasoline with the tool equipped fuels it from the barrel) -Compactor - Deployable powertool to work as an advancement of the road tool. Is placed like a cart, runs on gasoline or biodiesel, and is guided by 'pushing' it around. Compacts tiles in a 2 wide path into dirt roads. Allows for mid to late game quick deployment of basic roads without use of calories. -Lawnmower - Deployable powertool to work as an advancement of the scythe for cutting large swaths of grass for plant fiber. Is placed like a cart, runs on gasoline, and is guided by 'pushing' it around. Cuts grass in a 2 wide path. -Electric Lumbermill - A sawmill powered by electricity rather than mechanical power, twice as fast as the regular sawmill with maybe more/different/new recipes for late game wood use. -Air Compressor - A placeable 'workstation' that powers nearby pneumatic equipment. Runs on gasoline or biodiesel and occupies a 2x2x2 space. -Portable Generator - A placeable workstation that powers nearby electric equipment. Runs on gasoline or biodiesel and occupies a 2x2x2 space."

The put the problem in a nutshell: Eco encourages players to not play Eco. More specifically, it encourages you to either AFK or logout so you can gain skill points without using all the food you have. Attaching skill gains to your ""fuel"" encourages you to conserve that fuel for skill gains, suddenly its not the fuel you have for performing actions, its the fuel you need to increase your capacity for performing actions. A system that encourages not playing is a bad system. Without efficiency skills, everything in this game takes a laughable amount of energy, I've chopped down many trees and can assure you it doesn't take 1/3 of your total energy. So of course afking until you have that efficiency seems like the smartest route to take. Maybe attach skill points to actually performing actions, rather than having the fuel required to perform them. Encourage playing rather than not playing."

I hope stuff like that happens in the future with other aspects of the game. Indeed, I'm seeing people do that AFK stuff to get skill points right now while neglecting their house, and I'm racing ahead of them in terms of skill point generation.  It was a whole lot of work to set up a house, but it was very much worth the effort. And no, building a house with multiple rooms and putting in furniture wasn't a late game feature.  My house was complete with 50 sp/day by the end of day one on a vanilla server (no special features turned on and no scrolls/books given to me either).  It took me a week to get to that level with food. Like I said, I hope more features like a home bonus get added to the game.  I don't know precisely what they could be or how to encourage other professions to get some credit besides cooks or carpenters, but something specific like building a road to a road network and getting bonuses from being ""connected"" to a neighbor might be one of them where perhaps even the quality of the road (dirt vs. asphalt) might make a difference. There are some alternative ways that skill points can and should be generated."

Plus you can always do the work and eat more food, its more expensive but with more labor youll be able to afford it, in theory.

A small table designates a room as a living room
A latrine makes it a bathroom
A bed (there are several) makes it a bedroom
Most cooking stuff (except the fire) make it a kitchen.  An easy one to start is the Butchery Table and doesn't cost much in skill points to create
A general room is a room with none of the above Each of these needs to be in its own ""room"", meaning something with four walls and no openings larger than two high by one wide on doors or a couple small windows one block high.  That means separate rooms.  Also don't mix furniture like what goes in a kitchen and add a latrine... as that destroys the room bonus.  Also, don't put in ""industrial"" stuff like a blast furnace or bloomery and put those in yet another room. To balance the house, you simply need to make sure that the point total for furniture in each room is roughly the same.  Sort of like the nutrition bonus. Doing all that, you can easily get to 50 skill points per day for just your house.  That goes a long way and really helps avoiding the dire need of relying strictly on nutrition for skill point gain. I wish there were more ways to do this like having skill points for clothing or as I mentioned being on a road network.  This is something which really needs to be expanded a whole lot more so food prep isn't seen as the only way to get those skill points. I hope that helps to understand.  And it is indeed possible to make this very useful."

That is the super buggy aspect, and I think it is a larger issue than just housing (which I think is by itself working just fine).  I've had similar issues with the carpeter's table where the sawmill doesn't get recognized until after I take it out with a hammer and put it back down. Similarly a room under my house made of bricks holding my blast furnace kept bugging out where again after a server reset I would need to take a brick out and put it back simply to get a batch of steel to continue getting processed. Also, if you have a tree growing through a wall, it can do some screwy things with what might be a room or not.  That may have even been the source of many of your ""super buggy"" problems too. I'll admit it is a complicated programming challenge to recognize that a room is in fact a room in a 3D space in real time.  I'm impressed that the devs got it there, but one thing I really don't think they've screwed up at all is the housing point system itself as long as a room is recognized as a room.  Since you do need so many different rooms and random stuff (of all types, not just housing furniture) bugs out from time to time, it can impact the house value. Oh.... one more thing I forgot to address:  Every ""room"" needs to be on property you've claimed with claim flags under your name.  Sharing a house with another player means they (or whoever has the room) gets the housing points and not you.  You can have separate ""wings"" of a ""base"" where you have common equipment shared like a workbench, blast furnace, etc. , but the housing stuff must be on claimed property that you personally own.  Plan accordingly."

The issue I was pointing out was that this is the only game that makes you choose whether you want to gain skill points or go do all that mining and wood chopping you mentioned. If people are low on quality food (like when farms aren't ready to harvest yet) they just log out or afk to conserve calories because everybody will prioritise long term skill point gains over gathering. The fact that eating lower calorie foods also penalises you with a lower skill gain rate means most people just wait until they have access to the better quality food again before they use any calories on labour.

There are discussions about adding support for IPV6.  IPV4 is need because UPnP IGP is used setting up the client server.  IPB4 is only needed if you are going to be hosting the server.   It is understood that some ISPs in the EU do not, as a matter of course, offer IPV4 to their customers and this has on a couple of occasions meant that players have been unable to set up servers that would connect, although they still had access to play on other servers and with other players.  In only a couple of instances that I know of has the cplayer no been able to get IVP4 enabled on their account because they absolutely wants to host a server.  Hosting a server is not necessary to playing the game. i work closely with several German Game Hosting companies and they host the servers with IPV4 available so that maybe an option to look into if you are unable to get your ISP to enable IPV4 for you"

Perhaps the latrine might become important for more than just housing quality, and advanced WC's that empty them self - if they have pipe-connection to a septic tank.
As we burn calories, our maximum calorie count could be reduced by one-tenth of what we burned, resetting only as we enter a room with a latrine. Suddenly we would build small outhouses in our mines, near our farms, and along long roads (on larger worlds).
The WM professional would travel from house to house, collecting waste and bringing it to a dump. Later on, as pipes takes over this role, he/she can focus on possessing waste.
In addition, workstations should all create waste, starting to fill our chests until we get rid of it. Garbage cans might auto-pull such waste, so we don't have to manually sort it out of our chests. Do you think waste should be bulky items (akin to building materials, ores and wood), or small items?"

And I agree with workstations should all create waste, right now they have no impact on the environment except for the mats needed to make them. Having workstations that create waste is a great idea to expand on the principle of the game to keep the environment clean. This should increase the desire to have a WM profession and give it more of a role in the game. The auto-pull function is already sorta in the game, as each craft station creates items it goes to the first chest on the list. Now I've seen a proposal for an extra tab for input/output destinations that would be nice, and include a waste tab to this and we are good to go. With the Latrine and having to use it, we should have a water treatment plant for this and have a sewer system with pipes that take the waste to the treatment plant.

The Recycle centers should not have a huge impact on the environment as it is seen as a “Green” way of waste management. This idea is worthwhile as it will teach as well as give gamers a new profession in the game and help resolve some issues with storing items in the chest and just forgetting about it. In our age, we don't do that we use landfills and recycle center to accomplish this task. Any ideas and discussions on this would be welcome to make it better and give the dev team a real roadmap thanks for your time."

ideas-feedback,Build from stockpile and work clothes | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3874/build-from-stockpile-and-work-clothes,632,3,1,andbruu,"I think it's great how the game limits what I can carry around when it comes to large components such as dirt, stone and building materials. Gives an incentive to build carts, and therefor roads.
However, it is a chore building larger buildings, especially if they have multiple floors. Getting back down to the stockpile every 10th block quickly becomes hard work, rather than fun progression.
I suggest that the large items carried by a player will replenish from nearby stockpiles, as they are spend.
This ability could be locked behind a skill, or more interestingly behind cloth or equipment.
Say you need a builders jacket to automatically restock on building materials, and a construction workers helmet to restock on road blocks.
This would also give tailoring more importance, and open up for even more ""abilities from clothing"" (teamsters pants allowing you to pack more mass into carts, haulers boots to carry more items and move carts faster, miners helmet to provide light, hunters vest to recover arrows from cadavers, fisherman's boots to highlight fish traps, and so forth). The more abilities and the less stats we gain from cloth, the more interesting.

8 x Raw meat -> 1 x Prepared Meat 4 protein 6 fat you are loosing 1300 Calories  52 Protein  18 Fat The more you process the carcass the more you loose.

We have discovered your great game 5 days ago and we have been playing almost non-stop. You created something fantastic, gripping, relaxing, inspiring, fun and engaging - we absolutely love it. We can't wait to see where Eco will go in the next months/years and would love to provide you with some feedback, as we really want Eco to be a great success and go far in the game world! We are playing in a group of 5 people at the moment on a server we created. We sped up the day/night circle (half the time), there is a full skill refund for unlearning a profession and added experience for crafting and actions (0,0005 for crafting and 0,0005 for actions). Why? After 2 in real life days we felt these changes were necessary for us to keep going and not lose fun and stamina while playing. We've collected a few points that we would love to share with you. Maybe they can help make Eco even more enjoyable. What we absolutely love
The game forces you to work together, but in a way that makes sense. One can focus on this skill and one can focus another and together they can progress to an even cooler skill. Also love how certain machinery actually requires materials from a range of professions. Its very satisfying, engaging and social.
The balance of the game is great, we love that almost every skill requires some sort of team work / effort. Newly researched skills bring another factor to the whole world.
The whole look and feel of the world, how gathering, digging etc. works. What we feel could use some more love or additional features Tailoring: Feels like a waste of time, as the items are purely cosmetic or ""just"" needed for the excavator.  How about scuba-diving gear? Hazmat suits (when you get close to the tailings)? Beekeeper suit? (And yes, beekeeping would be awesome)? Hunting gear? Farming suits? Would love to see this profession getting more love. Paper milling: I appreciate where this is headed, but I feel you could take it even further. Books for the houses? Notepads? Creating maps? Linking chests and stockpiles: We found that every individual has to link each stockpile and chest, would love if one person would be enough and if it applied for everyone. Also slightly bigger chests maybe? There is no logical linking system for the stockpiles, needs some work, we feel. Tailings: They never decay and can't be used for anything else. I love this, it reminds me of toxic waste from nuclear plants. However, Eco's ""end solution"" for them (storing underground) feels very meh to me, as this is very unrealistic to not spread poison underground and, if I understood that right, Eco wants to think further and help its players to create solutions to be as eco-friendly as possible. Therefor, I would love to see another solution to this wasteful problem. Queued projects: There is no way to hover over the project to see whats actually missing. You get the icons and it shows you how much is missing, but when some materials have the same icons, it gets confusing. You can go to the skillbook and check it there, but allowing for hovering over the items to show it's tooltip would add a little more quality of life. Skill trees: overall i think that a branch system would be better, because its easier to know what skill/ability comes first and what`s for later use. Its not very intuitive right now, and if you wouldn't get a full refund for reskilling it would bother me a lot. Building:  Being able to rotate blocks on all axis, would make for much more customization on the houses. Dirt: We see where you are coming from with one shovel only holding one dirt, but for consistency's sake carrying more without having to bring a cart would be cool. Power sources: When entering e.g. the wind turbine it would be cool to see how much of an area it is covering. Similar to the property claims. Machines: the cost of a machine could be upped substantially if you chose to add a filter to it, to create less pollution. Right now, you kind of have to accept pollution but can't actively combat our wasteful impact on the land. Farming: As I am a huge eco warrior and gardener myself, this profession was an easy pick for me. However, after 4 days playtime, I am a little disappointed.
Having to de-leaf trees for example prior to chopping them down for seeds is very weird. Also makes the trees look very stupid and wouldn't they die if left without leafs? The first day I got no seeds at all, which resulted in me going through the whole world, chopping leaves off to get some seeds. Also, some kind of ladder would make the leafs in top more reachable if that system is here to stay.
Using fertilizer made little to no sense to me, I achieve the best results by directly re-seeding when I pick and forage out in the world. The soil analyzer also comes very late in the farming skill tree, thus it feels like a tease. I think it should work like this: adding fertilizer to non-hot spot zones should make them into hot spot zones.
Picking up produce gives me a plethora of seeds, I do honestly not see the point in the seed making skill line. But maybe that's due to our small group of players. However, these seeds are non compostable/destroyable and they take up a lot of storage space. I understand, why you didn't add a destroy function, in real life you can't just destroy things to make them go away, but maybe a recycling machine, compost place or a seed shredder would help a little?
I personally expected to be able to make a veggie/wheat farm close to our village, however if not in hotzones, this is not possible, fair enough. Maybe a glasshouse could be implemented later? I do love going through the world gathering and replanting but it does get very repetitive and feels like a chore. While my buddies are building laser tools, I am still digging in the dirt and chopping tree leaves :D Fishing: Its pretty bugged and also not ""fun"". Maybe you already planned on improving it, but my Norwegian boys are fishermen irl and would love to waste whole days of their lives fishing in game as well. What we would love to see in the future More varied building options like fences, different shapes and styles.
Farm animals like chicken and cows (they also could produce fertilizer, pollute the air or could help with hoeing the soil or transporting dirt)
Taming wolves as pets? :D We obviously know the game is still in its early stages and yet you have come so far already. Our comments are in no way meant as criticism or negative in any way, but rather as constructive feedback for a game we all thoroughly enjoyed and wholly believe in. I hope this was a little useful and please accept our most sincere congratulations: you have created an amazing game. We cannot wait to see what the future holds. Best regards,

I'm the resident ""smelter"" of our group and as such I've had my fair share of run-ins with tailings. I love the idea behind them and how the line between progression and ecological waste is drawn in this game, but I feel like the solution to the problem is extremely mediocre. Right now, you smelt ores and get tailings. Tailings pollute the environment. Great, I love it. However, the solution to the tailings is pretty subpar in my opinion. Burying them under ground and hiding them away? I feel like this is a very non-eco friendly solution. ""Hiding away"" the problem doesn't make sense in my opinion. There should be some timeconsuming, drawn out way of dealing with them. Granted, I realize there is another option to Tailings, being the blast furnace. That is nice as well, but we ended up producing 5 stockpiles full of Tailings before we even got to the blast furnace. By then it still felt like there was no other option than to heavily pollute the ecosystem since you need iron (steel) for pretty much any machine going forward. I would personally love to see more intuitive ways to save the environment (atleast somewhat), hence why I suggested expensive airfilters that could be attached to machinery. This still doesn't take away from the Tailing problem though, as I now sit with 5 stockpiles full of Tailings that will never go away :^)
Nevertheless, this is the best 20 euros I spent in a long time and the 40 hrs so far have been well worth it, so thanks alot for that."

Maybe add a way for people to teach their skill for a certain amount of time. let me explain how i think you could do that: When you have all the points in a Speciality, you become a Professional.
A Professional can teach his skill by printing a ""Skill Manual""
The skill manual is printed in a ""press"" with paper, of course the press is made by the paper guy, which will by the way make this profession more usefull.
Each people can only print manual where they are a Professional.
The manual does not last very long (from 5 min to  15 min maybe ?) This would be interesting for at least the contruction professions, (wood,stone,brick,and so on...) no idea if this will be good or unbalance other professions. What do you think of this people ? Bye"

The point in domain names is we don't have to worry about IP address's changing as the dns keeps a record of the IP address, but it's clear eco server is doing something wrong, I have read many people have problems and it all seems to be down to the server listener or the connection to a server. direct connection IP or domain will help check these problems, also there is no need for some middle man list when you connecting a to a friends server or group server, and almost all servers hosted are using full domains, what ever your doing to convert back to IP sure is not working."

I know that fertilization, irrigation, mechanization and greenhouses are or will be implemented. so I will not comment on them here, but biotechnology and the ability to create GMOs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TmcXYp8xu4) could be a late game ability that can increase crop yields, make plants more resistant, increase the speed of growth, and even add effects to plants such as boosting soil fertility, cleaning the air and pollution. in livestock, more meat for animals, faster growth, less food consumption and characteristics such as stopping to escape, docility and greater fertility. Environmental risks are as important as the benefits, so their use will have to be regulated, well planned and executed to avoid potential problems. or used to solve some problems, avoiding creating others.
this type of mechanic is extremely difficult to add to a game, some are made only with this mechanic, but made simple enough will add a new layer of depth and options for players.

It's not unprecedented either. Elite: Dangerous followed this model, for example, making alpha access quite expensive. Actually it seems to be pretty common for Kickstarter games. The high price is intended to keep the population low while still providing a decent revenue stream. They could probably make a lot more money by selling it at $20. For half the price, purchases may more than double or even triple. If you keep the population low, you don't have to spend so much resources on support. If you keep the price high, you get higher quality alpha testers. You're right, Minecraft is a success story, but I think the devs' model has a lot of good reasons behind it."

The benefit of having a higher price during this early in alpha would be you would only get the people that truly believe in the game to help out testing and reporting of bugs.
The downside is you get a bunch of people who cannot afford 40 bucks to buy the game a few months earlyer then the steam release where they did hint at a price tag at around 20bucks. So... if you cannot afford 40bucks to play an alpha version of the game or dont want to deal with this many bugs that are currently in the game... wait for steam release.
It's so simple.
However the is no pleasing some people.
If the game instead would not be open alpha people would complain about it not been released... kind of jumping up and down in the backseat going ""Are we there yet? Are we there yet? what's taking so long?"".
If the game would be let's say 5bucks ( let's go over cheap since we are dealing with people that do not think supporting indie devs is a good thing but they would probobly buy a AAA game for 60 bucks or more ) we would get alot of people buying the game... but... we would also get a large % of those people going ""uuuugh... buggs..."" and uninstall the game to NEVER touch it again not even when all those bugs are fixed with the main resoning ""i tryed it during the alpha... i did not like it... it was too buggy"".
And it could be something realy silly like in 5.3 the block placement was realy wonky wich they fixed in 5.4 but if someone made ther mind up that they did not like the block placement they would NEVER bother to revisit the game or check ""did they change this?"" unless someone took a black magic marker and wrote it on ther screen. So... 40bucks too much... dont want to support indie devs so they can put more hours into the game before release... dont like bugs... wait for steam release."

I've heard a lot of complaints about expensive games in alpha but I think you need that throttle on your player base during alpha.  Making a game more accessible may create a bigger community and short term gain but it has a way of burning new games out before they finish and you spend more time fighting hackers and malcontents.

ideas-feedback,Server Admin Tools | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3105/server-admin-tools,2048,4,1,York,"With steam beta rapidly approaching I am getting a little worried about what kind of game Eco will be once we are exposed to a more general public group such as steam players. I have been hosting minecraft servers for around 6 years now and have experienced a great deal of negative gameplay, thankfully with the huge minecraft community, server admins were given alot of tools to work with in terms of managing thier servers and communities. We all know there are players out there who are not interested in playing the game, but are out to essentially disrupt others from enjoying it. We attach terms such as griefers and trolls but basically these kinds of players get enjoyment out of ruining the game for others. In a game like Eco, its very nature will attract people like this and cause a great deal of misery to others who just want to play the game as intended. Chat Logs - Currently there are no readable chat logs available, having a readable chat log history file would be the a huge help in determining who is playing the game and who is trying to offend others. Logging tools -  This is essential to working out who did what, where and when, in most cases this in itself can limit any potential repeated damage caused by griefers, without knowing who and what they did the potential for repeated griefing by the same person(s) is high, making the entire thing a merry go-round. Vanish - Many will know this one from Minecraft, but the ability for admins to become invisible so they can monitor griefers is also a very handy tool, stealth griefers are those who try to hide what they are doing when any staff are around, making the entire thing a cat and mouse game, this results in a great deal of time being spent by admins trying to 'catch them in the act'. A silent login is usually attached to this kind of command also. Law restrictions - Whilst there is a default citizenship law, laws in general can be used in such ways as to completely destroy the world/server, things like granting of all skills, granting of currency and so on means server admins will basically need to either restore a backup or create a new world, both very damaging to server communities, there needs to be a review of what type of laws can be enacted and an assessment of the kind of damage they can cause. Kick and Ban - Not going to say much on this one as there is a github issue already and being able to use those commands without a server restart is a good start towards giving admins the tools they need to manage thier servers. I am sure there are many other potential griefing scenarios, tailings left in stockpiles for example (admins can /unclaim those however but a law to force stockpiles with tailings to become public would help alot). I have seen griefers and trolls completely dominate servers before, they drive players away, not just from the server but from the game itself, people spending 100's hours on something only to be ruined in a matter of minutes/hours. Situations like that and the subsequent bragging will attract more griefers to the game and suddenly those steam reviews will be full of comments like 'Toxic community' and other negative comments that can have a big impact on how well a game is received, if the mood swings like that then some games never recover from the stigma."

Say if you're building a cart, you need to craft the wheels then physically put the wheels on the cart. This would allow something like wear and tear for vehicles into the game, such as if you use a wheel on a cart for too long, it may break and need to be replaced."

From the primitive (building a roof over an area makes it cooler) to the industrial (an electricity-guzzling air conditioner that makes the whole structure cooler),  it could have a lot of effect on the way people build. Above all, it would make the long-term consequences of industrialization more material. When heat waves or freak storms make people get hungry, they'll know why. Likewise, it makes the planet's climate zones more important, as building in the desert no longer simply means that food is harder to get -- working outside is exhausting!"
ideas-feedback,-[Not enjoyable content] Farming- | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3610/not-enjoyable-content-farming,703,1,1,Bobbin Whood,"Farming i feel in this state is not as it should be. As a sandbox with the pollution and such of real life farming is too big of a problem in the early game. Crops weigh wayyyy to hard on the land they were given.
Example: Trees and plants start screaming they dont have enough space when there is nothing near. For this reason going into the skill tree of farming is not even worth it. Water on land is also a problem even if there are trees growing on that land and a lot of bushes it can still say the water level is very low. When i place dirt next to water it still has almost no water in it. Maybe instead of aquaducts we should have watering cans for the early game since you need a lot of wood etc wich will thin out the forests and it will be really hard to replace those.
I may have seen something over my head but almost no one knows how to work with plants in this game. It should be less of a ""get everything right, OR!"" and more of an ""this 3x3 area is has these values"" wich you can impact with farming tools."

So i can get the current money (and other stats) they have and use that to set laws for those who control the most money. (Example below). And set variables and/or programming in JavaScript (because its a web-browser) for more advance stuff. And/or just make a json file for export and import (Download/Upload laws).
json files are good because they are easy to modify and my guess is that the law system already is in a json variable when you post it to the server(?) so converting it to a downloadable file on the server should be no problem (Also unity have JsonUtility class in C#). Example of advance law:"
ideas-feedback,Sugestions and feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3454/sugestions-and-feedback,986,8,1,katrex,"so, first of all, i will preface this with my group and I all bought the game a couple of days ago and have been playing as a group of between 3-5 for most of the weekend. We are enjoying it so please take it as we mean it. constructive criticism. While I cant say how to make the late game experience better I think I have some valuable qol and more specific mechanical changes. That would at least vastle improve our, the new player experiance. qol Change 1: Have the drop down menu for the world map lenses (eg wheat productivity, bison, biomes) REMEMBER what the last thing you were on was. Having to scroll all the way down to flick between various productivity lenses when trying to figure out what a particular area of land would be good for is a reall pain in the butt. ALSO please put in some sort of multiple selection options,  so that i could look at ""all foods"" all plants all trees etc . Or split the drop down in to smaller tabs that could be scrolled between with the mouse scroll or number keys. With a handy hint on the screen telling you which mapmode you were currently looking at. QOL 2:
carts getting stuck on ramps, and ramps not properly attaching to the earth at the top of them. QOL 3: Deeds and permissions: Give people the option to have Look, deposit, and withdraw as separate options on chests. QOL4, If I put a work table flush to a hewn wall, could it not stick halfway through it, And can the thin hewn walls also attatch to a floorboard instead of leaving a gap? QOL5 Can we delete items, I don't want a stone hammer clogging up inventory while i have iron available. Could repair stations be linked to your stockpile? And after you repair can the item automatically go back to your inventory QOL6: The walking animation for other characters needs work... QOL7 If i have food in my action bar, can right-clicking or pressing its number cause you to eat the food? Now the big ones. Food and skill  points:
I only care about having a balanced diet before i log off, its not worth the effort to manage it while playing. This probably isn't gameplay you want to encourage. I would suggest the following.
Skillpoints unlock skills. And using skills levels them up, with 1 skill point required to unlock the next level. Level 4 efficiency should take time to get, something along the lines of a week of regular effort While being balanced increases the rate the skills level. Being full or close to full should give you faster actions like chopping trees runing etc, but hunger should decrease faster the more full you are.
(less decided suggestion) Being starving should make you unable to work but should stop your skill leveling and should be slower. So at least you can finish your job, all be it slowly before going home to get more food) Skills should have synergies, eg Unlocking lumber should cost less if you have logging/wood construction. This might be a good solution to the feeling that the skills get too expensive too quickly. that's all for now. Thanks for reading.
Despite all this absolutely loving the game and can't wait to see what it turns in to."

First: My english isn`t very good but I will try and I hope you will understand me.
I like this game, really, I would like to play it for avery long time.
And this is my feedback for you:
I have chosen the job ""Chef"" in this game.
First you start with the Campfire Cooking and then Advanced Campfire Cooking.
There are two meals with 28 Points: Wild Stew and Campfire Stew.
We were happy because this points will help us to get several skillpoints/day.
The next one i have to learn is the Cooking Skill Book (Home Cooking) and then I can cook a lot of meals in the Cast Iron Stove.
But, guys, what is that? I spend a lot of hundred skillpoints to get this skill tree and there are meals with 20 points, 22 points, 24 points.
Only one meal called Crispy Bacon with 32 Point and Stuffed Turkey with 29 Points.
The ingredient of the Crispy Bacon is meat, give me only Protein and Fat.
The ingredients of the Stuffed Turkey are Vegetable, Bread and Prime Cut.
Bread. Bread is in the Skilltree of Advanced Baking, you call it now Leavened Baking (Bakery Oven)
Advanced Baking is the penultimate Skilltree.
How can i cook Stuffed Turkey with Bread??
Bevor I use Advanced Baking I have to learn Basic Baking.
With Basic Baking (Bakery Oven) it is the same as Home Cooking.
There is no meal with more points than 28.... No one!!
But, guys, bevor I learn Basic Baking and Advanced Baking I have to learn the Advanced Cooking Skill Book (Culinary Arts) - Kitchen.
In this Skilltree are two Meals with 48 Points (Crimson Salad) and 49 Points (Sweet Salad).
Do you notice something?
There are no meals with 30 or 32 or 34 Points....
Campfire - Wild Stew, 28 Points, Campfire Stew, 28 Points
And then later later later.....after spending hundred of Skillpoints the Crimson Salad 48 Points and the Sweet Salad 49 Points. This can`t be right.
I am not a player who wants to get everything in a game immediately but this Cooking-System is not thought out well.
It is illogical.
Hope you understand what I want to say.
Greetings
Angela"

The drainage streams are pretty self-explanatory: you lay them down and they drain water away to a river or a lake. They can be seen as ""level 1 drainage"". As a more advanced option to drainage streams, you have drainage pipes. They can be set to a specific moisture level and are underground. As a more advanced option to aqueducts you can have a spray system, also this can be set to a specific moisture level (except if it is lower than the current level).

ECO is a game where communication is very important. In Economy Viwer 's Currencies, multibyte character user names are displayed, that is, the possibility to internally use multibyte characters. It does not necessarily need to correspond to multibyte character input from the keyboard.

Other game servers (one example would be Ark) supplied on Steam allow you to use SteamCMD anonymously, which means you can very easily automate checking for, and applying server version updates from Steam, which greatly improves automation for users and admins, and means that users don't have to wait for an admin to be online (i.e. awake) to manually update and restart the server."

ideas-feedback,Skill points and the food. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2699/skill-points-and-the-food,3626,6,1,Mog,"So I've been enjoying eco a lot. I find it absolutely amazing. But there is one thing in particular that have been bugging me tremendously. It's the way you gain skill points. It's a core concept of the game. And the idea behind it is supposedly to promote eating healthy. But It is overshadowed by the fact that more advanced food give more, even without a balanced intake.
Not only it doesn't make much sense and work against the balanced alimentation concept. But it hurts the gameplay really bad. In eco right now, unless you have access to a great amount of good food in some way,  you get PUNISHED hard for doing any action. Every plot of dirt you dig, anything, is a sacrifice of calories. And with the way the food values averages, when you find yourself forced to use lesser quality food you lose in skill/day. And half of what we do in eco is waiting on skill points to learn new talents. So you have situations where your cook friend is afk today, no food left, you need to choose between eating low tier food and work, but lose on tons of skill point, or just log off. And those situations arises very often. You are new on a server, they have amazing food, but you can only afford one. Well if you need the skill points your best bet is to eat it and log off. It's a dreadful mechanic honestly. In real life, exercise makes you healthier. In other games, doing actions is what make you gain xp. Because it seems like a good idea to reward your players for playing the game. In eco, no. You want to play eco today? You need to buy that privilege to your local cook. This is making the game a lot more hardcore that it needs to be. And is hurting teamwork as well. Other people have a cool project of building a bridge or whatever they can use your help with? You can go and help them but you will lose on skill points. It feels awful. You end up putting a price on every single one of your actions and never do anything for free. FeelsBadMan My two cents ideas to fix the problem: Remove the calories mechanic. Replace it with a timer. At the end of the timer you are too hungry to perform any actions.
That way you are not penalising players for playing your game. Also there could be the interesting concept to have some advanced food that give a lot of xp/day but don't feed you for long, and other advanced food that give less nutriment but feed you for a very long time Alternatively, make the food tiers a lot more even, or even totally even. Stop giving tons of extra points to high tier food. So that the balance of nutriment is what matters. And so that you can decide to eat some berries without getting food poisoning. You know, like in real life. The problem with this solution is that as the skill/days wouldn't ramp up as they do now, and advanced food a lot less valuable, a bunch of things would need to be reworked. But that way you could make the advanced food more about efficiency, or about the quest to the perfect 25/25/25/25 ratio and hit closer to home on the balanced alimentation.
Gaining skill points say twice as fast is already a big deal. The fact that you can gain skill points 100 time faster than somebody else in the current system just by having access to high tier food is blowing my mind and is unnecessary imo.
All it does is making it really easy to have crushing inequalities in your world. And I don't think it's a great thing to have in a game supposed to be educational and promoting a better future. I'm sure there is other ways to go about solving the skill point issue. Also in any case, your food should stay ""in your stomach"" for a shorter time. Or make it so there is a limit of how many dishes can be in there and remove the previous ones in a queue fashion. Right now without the /vomit command I don't know what I would do. I know it is a very core concept to the game and so a sensible issue. But I really would love to see it changed at some point. Anyway thanks for reading, and thanks for making this amazing game."

Early game the differences in sp you get are huge and I think it's a big problem, but from the ""wild stew"" up to the stove era it becomes a lot more marginal from what I have seen, it takes a lot more resources to grab a few more sp/day. And when you eat food that are not top notch it doesn't ruin your xp too much as long as you don't eat raw or campfire food. I think they need to boost the values of the raw and campfire food way up, and make sure future food don't have ridiculously high values, and it will be all fine. And well those kind of tweaks are the ones you make during beta I guess. But yeah the early game food situation is super harsh right now. If you do anything else than farming cooking and then logging off you get way behind the other players is SP. It's sad in a lot of ways.

Early building is also the time when your mind is super active (and probably playing protracted periods of time) - hence you'll feel that the low SP really hurts development. This is why I suggest that player action during this time should be rewarded (limit to a degree, if you want anti-grinding/obsession mechanics in place.) And when I say making food, I mean not just selling it from his or her own shop, but actually offering the skill to other players' estates by actually making house calls and cooking food from storage there. This kind of gameplay requires a lot more community and social trust, however - something not everyone could or would do. This kind of ""talent sharing"" by house calls was one of the intents of the game mechanics, and for better or worse, the devs are making it happen."

After much research on the forums, it was suggested that the table required 3 tiles of room height for placement. After raising the roof on my room one layer, the table placed successfully.
The requirements list should include any dimensional requirements for the cubic space, not only a simple volumetric measurement, ie
requires

I personally feel like compared to other bi-products on other skills, tailings are much more difficult to deal with than other bi-products. You have to dig a large hole, and if you're me you can't figure out how to seal them off properly to ensure you don't get ground pollution. Players have resorted to storing tailings in carts and I'm about to do the same. Here's my suggestion... Let's have a special Stockpile... A tailings stockpile! Let's make that stockpile un-placeable unless it's at a specific Y level. Today I put a stockpile at Y level 35, I covered it with mortared stone, filled it with tailings and sealed it off. Boom, massive ground pollution on the surface. The Tailings Stockpile IMO seems like a pretty fair compromise, without the confusion of trying to figure out how tailings should be stored. You still have to do work to prevent pollution, but as long as they're in a box at a specific Y level, you can be sure they won't pollute the ground. :)"

ideas-feedback,State of the Game (Improvements small and big) | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3294/state-of-the-game-improvements-small-and-big,1014,3,1,Nes,"Hi, everyone! I've been playing Eco consistently as we hurtle towards Beta. I've played on worlds in 6.3 and 6.4. I just wanted to share some of my thoughts on aspects of the game, from much needed short-term quality of life fixes to longer term gameplay issues. Before I begin, I just want to say that I greatly appreciate all the hard work the devs are doing, and I'm sure many of these ideas are already planned or on the radar. I just want to share these ideas from a (non-education-focused) player's perspective: The addition of linked storage was a huge improvement for the game, but is still frustrating to manage your home and store because the linked storage radius is not obvious. Also, the storage windows can get very hard to manage, especially because they must be rearranged for every storage/crafting table. To combat this issue, we need to be able to visualize linked storage radius when holding storage or crafting table items, similar to how property claims work. During this visualization, unlinked storage/table objects should be highlighted red and linked objects (within radius) should be highlighted green. This would make base planning much easier. Storage management is even more of a headache if the player does not name their storage appropriately. Prompting players to name their stockpiles or chests upon placement may help alleviate this. Several times I have run into the issue where a tree fell on top of a stockpile or on another person's property. The stockpile takes precedence over the tree, so I have to clear the stockpile and pick it up to be able to chop up the tree. When the tree is on someone's property, I am able to chop it up, but can't pick the pieces up if they are inside tree debris. These issues are both quite frustrating. Bottom line, we need better contextual behavior to combat these issues. The way the skill tree works can be very confusing to new players. The main problem we are all familiar with is that players will quickly spec into some of the manual labor skills and then get screwed over with exponential specialization costs. I think we're all aware that the coefficient for these costs is too high in 6.4. I would argue that the skill system needs another overhaul, especially early-game. It should give the player more clear choices between 2 or 3 options. For example, you can choose Laborer or Mining or Logging at the start of the game; you can choose Cooking or Gathering. In these examples, choosing one locks the others (though this could be disabled in singleplayer). Further on in the game you can unlock the specializations you didn't choose at the start. This is more in line with how skills work in other games. Maybe Eco should move toward more of a traditional ""skill tree"" model that RPG players are familiar with. It would also help players visualize the entire technology tree if it were all condensed into one tree listing specializations (clicking each specialization could open its respective skill tree). This would give players a better idea of what they need to work towards. Barring a skill overhaul mentioned above, it would be nice in the current system for players to be able to see the costs of their next few specializations, so they can plan accordingly. A confirmation dialogue for unlocking specializations would also help players avoid choosing a skill unintentionally. Pollution needs to take a more central role in the gameplay of Eco. It needs to affect the growth of plants and animals and the health of the biomes. Biomes should transition into others in certain conditions. The problem with pollution always being the bad guy is that it discourages gameplay. Want to stop your blast furnace from destroying the environment? Stop making Iron Ingots! So, you've just given the player the option of A. not playing or B. causing pollution. If there were alternatives to iron ingots, this would be one thing. But, there aren't. So, we need more items and gameplay mechanics that actively combat pollution, so players are more engaged with fixing the environment. I'm talking CCS technologies, filters that could be applied to the ends of output pipes, ground pollution cleanup mechanics, things like that. One of the main challenges of pollution in Eco is that it should have a much more negative impact on wild plant growth, animal growth and agriculture. This would be the primary way that players will see pollution affecting them. Pollution would hurt their skill gain and actually prevent technological progress by restricting calories available. This interplay between skill progression, pollution, ecosystem, and available calories should be the central challenge of Eco. It deserves a lot more tuning. But agriculture needs to be more challenging than it is. Plants should have more precise moisture and temperature requirements to grow effectively. This would not only give players an incentive to settle multiple biomes and locations on the map (a good thing!), but it would also increase the impact of pollution on plants. Air pollution changing temperature and moisture patterns? You may have to move your farm, or use fertilizers and other items to keep your plants from dying. That's not to say that I think farmers should have to micromanage their plants' nutrients (phosphorus, nitrogen, etc.). I think this aspect of agriculture is a little too complex. But pollution should have more of an impact While the meteor game-mode provides a good incentive for players to progress as fast as possible in technology within 30 days, a lot of servers are opting to go meteor-free. This begs the question: What is it that is going to keep players playing? What is the incentive to progress, when you're only going to cause more pollution? One thing I've noticed is that a lot of players want to have a sense of permanence in their worlds. This is why they disable the meteor, and it's why a lot of players I've played with hate server wipes. Building things in Eco is challenging, and players don't want to lose what they have accomplished. I think players need more focused goals than simply the mission statement set forth by the world leader. For ultra-late-game, when players have amassed thousands of skill points, there needs to be an incentive for some kind of massive building projects: Things that require ridiculously big buildings or a ridiculous amount of resources. This sounds kind of obvious, but the game just needs more ""fun stuff"". Yes, it's a vague and subjective term, but the excavator is a great example. Vehicles like that are fun to use and tear stuff up with for your big building projects. To add to that there should be more ""fun"" things in the game, like: That's all the ideas I have for now. Thanks for reading! If you think an idea is particularly good or being overlooked, I can submit it to Github as a suggestion."

With new version (0.6.4.0) there is no more lags and freezes while you are connected to a server. BUT.. It became impossible to play solo and enjoy the game.
You are forced to play with others even if you don't want to integrate that much.. It's impossible to open skill trees as inflation is even worse than before. I understand the intention of developers, but if previously I've seen servers with few people online and enjoying the game, now it's just abandoned workbenches around the servers (except for few). Changes regarding skills trees & enforces specialization ruined the game."

Forcing specialization in this way and adding major penalties for training skills outside of your primary specialty does make it very hard to play.  At the very least, you may have at most one or two other people you cooperate with that help you out and everybody else leeches off of you on a public server."

Yes it makes it harder for people to basically solo on multiplayer, but this is supposed to be a game that forces each player to look at things differently. There are some things you can do to help your server, such as using the forums specifically for your server to communicate to other people while they are offline. On my server we have a low pop. Probably around 15 to 20 players but that's good enough for us to have a robust economy. The thing I would say needs to be buffed is farming. Since all one needs to do is get a hoe and enough seeds to supply themselves with out actually having to spend points in farming. All the while they specialize in cooking.

ideas-feedback,The ECO space program. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3241/the-eco-space-program,1768,5,1,CompactDisc,"I read some suggestions here about space construction/exploration and agree that it's a last-priority kind of thing. However, it doesn't have to be too complicated to work. I think it would add a lot of value to ECO. Especially adding a Mars-like planet. Since the entire world will soon be talking about Mars -- Satellites --
First of all, putting satellites in orbit probably wouldn't be too much work. All you need is a new rocket tech/specialization, a building to create rockets, a satellite and a rocket model + animation, and a launch pad.
As for the satellites themselves: just reuse the asteroid orbiting code. The code required is already in place, except perhaps for the rocket's flight to space. As long as you don't allow it to take humans it seems to be relatively simple.
I would suggest moving some systems (like global climate information) from the current omniscience-like system to the satellite network. -- Other planets --
This is a whole other level of gameplay of course. But it might not be all that hard to create other planets that you can travel to. It requires creating new  biomes of course (and maybe plants/animals), but only a little extra coding. It would likely share the base code with the normal Earth-world.
I'll assume the first planet to be added would be Mars and use it as an example below:Issue 1: Gravity
Gravity is just changing a constant, not much work required. Animations might need some tweaking though.Issue 2: Terraforming
The lack of oxygen is emulated by forcing the wearing of a space suit and using oxygen as a consumable.
Terraforming the atmosphere could be done using the current CO2 mechanics for other gases seems reasonable.
You can even terraform oceans using the sealevel mechanics. Start with oceans under the lowest land level, and have it rise up with more heat on the planet.
The only issue I can see is the lack of a magnetic field. But this could be solved by adding an 'artificial magnetic field' between the sun and the Mars-like planet. Some kind of late-game high tech solution to keep the atmosphere from flying away from Mars.Issue 3: Travel
Just add a loading screen between the rocket launch on Earth and arrival on Mars.
Perhaps add a way of setting the launch site on Mars using the 3D mars-map.
Anyhow, if it isn't done by the developers, I can imagine this will be modded relatively quickly. As long as there is no in-space floating around stuff it seems pretty doable."

ideas-feedback,The ECO space program. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3241/the-eco-space-program,1768,5,4,rentechd,"I can see a minor space program as a technology to going to an destroying the meteor - be a fun alternative to the lasers and would stay with the premise of the game.  The idea of terreforming worlds is a whole different game.  Firs of all tehre is a great leap between the reality of Eco and the utter Sci-fi fantasy of terreforming a planet. There is no way to start out on 'Mars' and terreform it.  Even if you do very little research on terreforming Mars you quickly find out that without more Mass, and a greatly enlarge the magnetosphere no amount of work done of the surface of Mars will terreform it.  In its current stat you could bring oceans of water and it would all out gas immediately.  mars would need more mass - brought by force collisions from other bodies (and then 1000's of years wait for the planet to stableize), it would need its core rotation speed up - NASA has put forward some plans about digging into the mantle and setting of explosions that would do this.  The other way is to coax some large bodies of other bodies into orbit around Mars at Lagrange points to use tehir magnetic field to shield Mars and hold water in and allow it to develop an atmosphere.  And taht is just teh very early start of terreforming a planet.  Terreforming a planet is still very much science fiction and really has little to do with ecology until a planet is well into a terraforming phase and supporting life.  Since most of what we would have to do to terreform a planet would need to be done from space - without technology we don't have except in fictional books,  would have to be done from space  most likely from generational ships big enough to go coax other bodies to Mars you are talking about a space exploration and terreforing game, not an ecology game. There is a huge leap from putting a guy in a rocket , in a space suit and sending him to a meteor to blow it up - and while that is still science fiction at this time for us - we do have the technology to do it and have landed unmanned probes on asteroids so the do-ability of the concept is there.  So even though do it would fall under science fiction, I could see the stretch to doing  as the byproducts of getting a man and a bomb to the meteor would be another polluting factor you would have to work against. Terreforming another planet, while totally science fiction and not based on any technology we currently have does not really have anything to do with ecology and community building etc.  Nothing that Eco is really about.   Terreforming a planet, even if you found one with the right mass and a magnetosphere,  would take generations unlike what you see in the movies.  Much of that time would be spent living aboard a ship orbiting the planet and when you could move to the surface it would still mostly be in sealed bunkers.  To terreform even the most cooperative planet would be a generational project and it would not be about ecology and community building and working toward saving a planet; but about team choosing and leadership, scientific experimentation and space exploration and developing a new world - a totally different premise.  Great premise for a different game but very different from the  game Eco and the systems in use in the game."

Having to specialise in these skills makes it WAY harder to specialise into the thing you want to actually do (if it isn't one of these). in conclusion :) i think the new system is great i love that people have to come together to get good stuff. but having it accompanied with the changes to the survival skill tree is causing a kind of throttling where you have to pick the mining and carpentering specialisations before doing anything else. so if your playing by yourself or in a server that hasn't got a lot of people or people that play at different times because of work etc. it becomes very difficult to get anything done and is counter productive to a growing community. so while this might not be a big deal if you have people you know who you want to start playing with, it is a big deal to people who play solo or join servers hoping to join/establish a community as they play don't plan on the playing the game if these things aren't changed. not as a threat or a jab at the developers but just because these changes don't fit my play style and go beyond making the game harder and enters impossible territory (for me). but i think you guys do have a great game here and hope people enjoy it even i wont be anymore, because i have enjoyed it so far so thank you ;P (if you guys even read this)"

That way, if a single person gives up or doesn't want to work in their area of specialization, others can easily step up as well as give an idea for new players what kind of specialty they might want to get into. I could imagine that this sort of extreme restriction might work in a classroom setting where teachers would even assign professions, but that doesn't sound all that fun to me. Typically in Eco you are on a server with about 4-5 active players... maybe.  On even a very busy server is only a little over a dozen active players and another couple dozen people who occasionally show up but aren't committed to the community.  That might change with Steam, but then again I see standard 100x100 worlds getting crowded very quickly in that situation too.  Most worlds can't hold over a couple dozen people. The largest problem I've seen with coins though is rampant inflation from people who mint the coins instead of doing any work like harvesting raw materials to help out."

There is a server setting that allows you to choose between following options:
NoCollaboration
LowCollaboration
MediumCollaboration
HighCollaboration I think the use for these settings is to punish solo-running on the higher settings but to perfectly allow it on the lower ones.
That way big servers can use the higher settings, and smaller ones the lower settings. Currently the settings are a bit off and one needs some manual adjustments to make it right, but the idea is there and just needs some balancing."

I've been playing on a couple public servers, and I've got to say that the stability of these servers simply needs to be fixed.  The servers need to be reset on a daily basis, sometimes twice a day or even more, and to me this is simply unacceptable.  If there is somebody running that server who is available to do the reset, it isn't terrible (still unacceptable) but playable. I get that this is an alpha release.  I get that there will be bugs and that potentially the game could be unplayable for awhile.  I also get that the developers of this game are trying hard to improve this game and that some things can slide where priorities happen elsewhere and sometimes bugs are going to be hard to find as well. All of this changes though if as is the plan that the game will be released to a much wider audience with the Steam Release and that this game is going to be called ""Beta"".  It doesn't mean that it needs to be perfect and that there can still be some occasional issues in terms of things not quite working right. Beta doesn't mean though that the game is unplayable.... especially a public beta.  While not feature complete, the levels of professionalism are going to need to be much higher and the quality of simply using the software (not necessarily gameplay elements or how it interacts.... but simply UI issues and being able to play the game at all in any form) has to work.  I can't emphasize this enough..... it must  work.  When you click the button to cause it to run, it will work and when running a server players can't get kicked out for light or everyday reasons that are unexplainable. If this was just a single server that was having configuration issues or had connection problems.... that could be addressed by the person deploying the server.  That isn't the case with this gripe here. My fear, because I really do like this game and because of what I really think the developers of what has been done so far with Eco need kudos for their hard work, is that when the Steam release happens that this game will get so many negative reviews and so many people complaining about the unplayable nature of the game so far that nobody will buy the game and that it will fade away as a failed effort.  I don't want to see this game crash and burn.  I could name some specific examples of games on Steam where this has happened... but I'll avoid advertising those negative examples and hope that Eco doesn't face that fate. And no, putting the server reset on a chron job is not sufficient.  That is a cheap hack and not what is needed.  Real bugs need to be addressed and when you run the server it shouldn't bug out for people playing that are hesitant about playing and don't really know what should be happening or not."

I've done software development (still am) and catching exceptions isn't going to handle all of the issues I'm seeing. Stuff like how players are working and then suddenly not able to place a block while other players can do that, or when performing a trade it freezes up are likely not going to be ""caught"" with an exception handler.  Those are hardcore logic bugs that aren't going to be solved until the issues which create those conditions are dealt with properly with sound algorithms and logic. There is a time and place to set up exception handlers and circumstances you shouldn't. If this was continuing to be an alpha release for the next several months and not going to steam, I wouldn't even bring this kind of thing up.  Work through those issues and make the game more stable with its code base while pulling out spaghetti code and cleaning stuff up that was an early programming experiment that is no longer needed.  That kind of debugging isn't glamourous and doesn't show up much on bullet points when doing a new release, but is important overall for any software development project.

LIke I said, a daily chron job of restarting the server is simply a cheap hack and avoiding software quality assurance and fixing bugs that need to be fixed.  It is professionalism that will be expected for those on Steam. If this is supposed to be normal, then don't release on Steam.  Hold back on the Beta release until these bugs get fixed. If it continues in this fashion, Eco will last a whole two weeks maximum on Steam before it will be dropped like a stinky pile of fertilizer with so many negative reviews that the devs will not be able to sell any more copies on Steam.  It will be a failed effort to even try to use Steam as a source of revenue. Go ahead and ignore my advise and criticism.  You don't owe me anything at all, but I'm simply offering this warning and suggesting the Steam release won't go very well unless stuff like this is fixed and fixed properly.  I wish the devs well, but this is the kind of thing they should ignore at their own peril.  It can be a permanent black eye to the whole project if that release doesn't go well."
ideas-feedback,Server Stability must be Fixed | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3235/server-stability-must-be-fixed,3036,13,6,ClayC,"HI Korihor, Although I partially agree with your previous statement, I have to disagree, While solving bugs is not catching exceptions, MOST of the crashes I see on many servers are easily captured via a catch, and atleast until the devs fix this issue, the players don't get bored of the crashing and restarting. So, I know that fixing bugs is not catching the exceptions. I am a software engineer, and have been for 11 yrs, but there are cases like this where the user base are getting pisse doff by the random crashes. These can be avoided and later handled. Anyways, the bug you mentioned, has never happened to me before, unless if the connection between the client and the server was ended. And after a few seconds you get the Inactivity message. Thanks."
ideas-feedback,Server Stability must be Fixed | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3235/server-stability-must-be-fixed,3036,13,7,King Korihor,"The only reason you use a ""Try.... catch"" type of expression in your software is to deal with things you know are going to happen and for it to be deliberate and intentional.  It usually has something to do with either thread management or perhaps some specific bit of code that is deeply nested within a whole bunch of subroutines you want to pop out immediately. I'm not saying it is something to completely avoid using like a GOTO type statement as it has its uses in programming, but to throw such programming structures around a block of code you know to be buggy is just simply being lazy and produces unpredictable results.  That isn't solving bugs, it is whitewashing them and hoping they go away. And no, it doesn't necessarily end the connection between the client and the server in the situations I've seen.  Perhaps I should post about it as a specific bug report, but it is a common enough occurrence that other players on multiple servers I've been on have mentioned it.  It isn't the same thing and a server spontaneously shutting down or freezing... although I've seen that happen too.  I've had the servers continue to operate on their merry way and have even multiple people log in and out... yet basic things within the game won't happen.  Sometimes it ends the connection, sometimes it doesn't. This appears to be a whole class of bugs and not a single one."
ideas-feedback,Server Stability must be Fixed | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3235/server-stability-must-be-fixed,3036,13,8,ClayC,"From my experience, when software / features are in early stages, we always add the try catch method, and we log everything into a database, so we can monitor any expceptions the users are experiencing. This is the best way to go about alpha's. For you to say otherwise, it shows how much lack of experience you have in the field. This is alpha, anything for them to catch bugs and help them fix them, kinda goes. We are here to help them test the game, so if you notice a bug, report it! Unless someone reports it, devs might not experience it and therefore might not fix it."
ideas-feedback,Server Stability must be Fixed | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3235/server-stability-must-be-fixed,3036,13,9,King Korihor,"When doing an Alpha?  Perhaps.  I'm not talking about an untested alpha pre-release candidate here.  I'm talking about what needs to happen when it goes into Beta or more importantly because those on Steam really don't care:  it will be a major public release. You say it shows how much lack of experience in the field I have?  I guess I don't have much in the way of game experience where stuff like this can slip and perhaps people at a place like Electronic Arts doesn't give a damn about its customers.  Instead, I've had to program stuff for millionaires that simply don't give a... heck... about your job if you screw up with stuff like this.  You simply get it right the first time when they have to use it.  You do quality assurance testing on multiple levels and if needed you even do proof of the algorithm. Should I report some of these bugs?  Perhaps.  I don't have access to server logs or save files since these aren't my servers I'm using.  And BTW, consider THIS to be a bug report as well.  If the devs don't read these forums, they should shut this forum down instead. I'm not expecting Eco to have the same quality of performance as perhaps a piece of medical equipment or something in aerospace, but I am expecting something of perhaps a bit more quality than what I'm seeing here.  If you want to keep this in Alpha and keep the community smallish who can work through bugs on this level, then go ahead and keep the existing practices and standards that I'm seeing.  It won't be good for the game or Strange Loop Games if it continues on like this for the Steam release though.  If you don't want to pay for quality assurance testing, then you get what you pay for too. You are expecting a whole lot from unpaid volunteers to be demanding they do anything.  Perhaps I might submit a formal bug report after digging through a bunch of pages to find out where the devs might be wanting to see that bug report.  The harder it is to do that, the less likely I will be to make such a report."

I had wanted to respond to Korihor's original post, but spam filters were blocking me. Anyway: Server stability really does need to be a top priority. I am the admin of the server Korihor is referring to, and there have been all sorts of ""soft"" crashes, such as crafting being halted, certain users being constantly kicked with an ""Inactivity"" message, or players not being able to place blocks. To the extent that these types of game-breaking issues can be prioritized, they must be. I think Korihor's heart is in the right place. Some of us are just more... pessimistic about Steam users' standards for an EA title with a $30 price tag. Sure, EA games have been around awhile and people will expect bugs. But if there are game-breaking bugs, they will complain, and possibly give negative reviews. None of us want to see that happen. Some of the server issues I've seen have been hard to reproduce, and are complicated by the fact that I've sometimes used admin tools for playability reasons (used Dev Tool to destroy a bugged crafting station, for example. Could this lead to a memory leak? I don't know.) I'm eager to help out with bug-testing on a ""clean"" server in 6.4, though!"

For example: There are many other possibilities for the law system, if you wanted to you could define every rule in the game (down to the behaviour of the animals) in laws if the system was general enough. I really think that the laws and contracts system has much more potential if some of these programmatic features were implemented Technical details related to programming:

In this script you would write several functions for events related to the law or what the law is about.
onLawCreate() - this function you implement gets executed when you finish writing up the law
onLawAccept() -  this function gets executed when the law is accepted and put into working. in this function you bind the event handlers to events like vote or place block or accept contract. This system would allow players that are able to script to create much more complex laws and even do complicated math to determine the outcome of certain actions. This would be a HUGE feature to implement is there is a lot of concern for the voters:
People who cannot script cannot understand exactly how the law works. they will have to rely on the reasoning provided by the player who created the law (often a reason is not provided I find). So these players will not be able to make an educated decision.
And on top of that you have the concern of technical security. basically if this feature is not implemented properly it might allow for skilled programmers to created hacks that will grant them free resources for example."

Right now I find myself sitting at the research table with skill tree open and going back and forth trying to figure out what skills I need to get to the next skill and the next skill and so on. Can we please have a more linear setup that tells us what skills we'll need to progress through to get to an ultimate goal? The current way of figuring it out could prove overwhelming for new players as I find very tedious even as an experienced player. It doesn't need a total overhaul of the current skill tree, but I think clicking on any specific skill should open up a little window of sorts and show you only the skills you need to acquire to reach whatever skill you selected. Second, we need some way to dispose of unwanted items. This could range from making these items compacted pieces of trash which we can fit tons of in chests, carts, or stockpiles, to simply burning it for a meager amount of energy to power things like campfires or blast furnaces. Third, can we have a stat added to the room stats telling us how much space is available for workbench type decorations in the window that automatically pops up at the bottom left corner of the screen? It gives us room volume and the materials the room is made from, but it doesn't tell us how much room we have available for said objects. That's about all I have for now and I'm sure I'll think of more things along the way."

I have only played about an hour of the game so far and by no means do I think I know what's what already :P. That being said, I feel like the skill point system is a great idea but could be expanded on. Historically, any game where I have to stop playing to wait for a timer is a major turn-off. Maybe consider adding an active half to the timer? Something like a more traditional xp system, where I take level 1 in logging using my skill point, but then the subsequent levels are gained by cutting down trees, the speed at which they are gained being determined similarly by your diet. I feel like it might also encourage specialization and cooperation, as logically, if you need wood, the fastest way is to ask the guy who IS the fastest, because he is ""experienced"" with cutting down trees."
ideas-feedback,An idea for active vs. idle progression | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2811/an-idea-for-active-vs-idle-progression,3883,13,2,emmeck,"The idea of skill evolution by completing an action has been brought up many times and from memory the main reason the devs don't want to go down this path is that players may start to over do certain actions just to get the skill points but not actually be using said materials there for wasting the stuff in the first place and potentially exhausting something the has a finite amount on the server making it impossible for other players to advance or build what they need to build and also perhaps cause server performance issues. E.g.. if someone wanted a high logging skill they could essentially just run around and cut down every tree on the server and that would cause major lag on the server Or perhaps they want a high hunting skill so they go and kill almost every animal they can see potentially wiping out an entire species just to get the hunting skill points However in saying all this I believe there should perhaps be a system that encourages active players perhaps if all you do is login and eat then logoff again you should get the full skill points for a certain amount of hours say 6-12 hours then after that it halfs the amount of skill points you earn
Or even do it the opposite way if your online and playing for 3 hours you get a small buff in skill point earning if your online and playing for 6 hours you get another buff in skill points. But I see a problem with that system that players will just stay logged in and go and do something else just to get the extra skill points but not actually be doing anything on the server potentially again causing server lag because so many people are logged into the server"

Maybe one way to combat the ""overuse"" of a skill would maybe be to buff the xp gain if you perform an action that aligns with a profession you chose, but hard-cap how much you could earn in a certain amount of time? So I proclaim myself a lumberjack, and receive much better experience while chopping, replanting, maybe even basic woodworking receives the buff. But in exchange.... Every attempt I make at cooking meat starts a forest fire and I just can't work out what I'm doing wrong >:( (cooking is more difficult and receives less experience). It would at least encourage a degree of specialization that I don't see harming the game. Thanks for replying though! I love it when someone shows me flaws with my logic! :) @Mog I can also see your point as well, and it was that first ""forced afk"" that annoyed me.... Maybe you're right and I'm overthinking... :P Edit: One thing I've experienced in idle games is that they usually track the mouse and keyboard and while something is moving or being pressed you get the ""active"" bonus... Of course someone could just install macroes to ""play"" the game for them. Also I'm looking for servers, does your's have a fairly active/good community?

But I think adding other element to it have more potential to make it worse than better. Any solutions we might come with will always be flawed and/or boring, because they are artificial mechanics aimed at preventing the player to do all he want to do. There already is an active progression in the game. It's the house you built, it's your stockpiles full of mats, it's the roads to your neighbours.
I feel like right now there is moments where you are cornered into afking. And that's bad. But I think it can be solved by simply adding content and tweeking numbers. Also the idea behind the idle progression is to allow the more casual players to catch up, and to force specialization. A grindy progression don't really add much to the deal. An online waiting game either."

One of the more important aspects of the game to us is allowing players who cannot play nearly as much as others to still contribute in a meaningful way to the server's progression. The main gate to this is the skill point system and even then it doesn't function perfectly. Players who play more will still manage to get better food and therefore better skillrates than those who play less (although they'll also have to eat more food) - I've always seen this as a sort of compromise between the allowing more active players to get ahead while still allowing other players to remain relevant. We have some planned systems that are aimed at taking the burden off of skillrate as the sole determining factor in a player's feeling of progression and to give players more to do to keep them active while their skills accrue. That all said, this is suggested enough that it may make it in as a server setting that is disabled by default (but probably not for a while). I'm sure there are some communities that would appreciate the flexibility."

We are 3 active players on my server, and we are at day 12 and managed to almost get everything. There is only one book left (Computer Science). While this is done, I keep getting points and specializing in more aspects of the game. (Cooking, Agriculture, Carpentry, survival wood-mine etc,  stone mason)  And I still get more points coming and LVL5 in everything...

One solution I believe we will add is a 'difficulty setting' which basically is a multiplier for how fast you get skill points.  A server that will have a lot of players, and lots of people specializing, can set this high and they will have to make heavy use of the economy and trade to succeed.  A server with few people, or even single player, can set this low and have their skills go up rapidly so they could basically play continuously.  I see this as necessary because trying to balance the specialization for a server of 100 people vs a server of 1 people without some sliding scale is pretty impossible. However we'll want to make some kind of presentation on this difficulty so that higher difficulty is more prestigious, so people dont just turn it to minimum by default and totally remove the point of skills/specialization/collaboration/the economy. As Mog pointed out its not good to have 'nothing to do', and that should never be the case, there should always be resources to collect, buildings and roads to construct, trades to make, government tasks to participate in, etc.  There should be a tempo to the game, where you're never blocked because there are always things to do, but then you do get level ups and suddenly you're a lot more powerful.  Ideas to help ensure that's the case are much appreciated. Thanks for the feedback awesome stuff."

Like what was stated before, a lumberjack cutting down trees and leaving the mess simply to acquire the extra skill points involved does create several problems but I think it's still a viable option with a couple tweaks to the idea. First of all, let's not give them the skill points right off the bat. Instead, only give them the skill points AFTER they clean up all the wood pulp and the stump and store the logs in a stockpile. Doing this should give them incentive to not waste what they used purely for skill points and even if they do just plop a stockpile down and chop down every tree in sight and gain all those skill points just to have them, it should be a fairly small amount. That half is geared towards preventing server performance issues caused by this particular mechanic. The next half should help allot with players draining the resources from the planet entirely. For lumberjacks the biggest problem would be the lack of trees left to cut down after everyone has gone around leveling the Amazon lol. To help alleviate this, they should be awarded with a substantial skill bonus to the relevant skills for replenishing the resources they used. For example, logging will give you a minor bonus for cutting down trees and cleaning up the mess but a hefty bonus for replanting trees. It should encourage players to replenish what they may or may not have used to advance in whatever specialization they chose. Just a couple of thoughts on the idea. Let me know what you think. I find that in this game you need to find a way to encourage the players or give them some kind of incentive to do something without unbalancing the whole ecosystem. Edit: Doing this may actually encourage carpenters and lumberjacks to grow tree farms to support their skills and be better for the environment while possibly leaving the majority of the naturally generated forests on the map mostly untouched. For this I would suggest making the drop rates on tree seeds a little higher though."

As you can see you're getting a 75% increase from 4 -> 5 but only a 25% increase from 0 -> 1.  I feel like there's little reason to just stick with 2-3 points in an efficiency skill. The benefits from the last 2 points seem too large too to me.

The one thing that gives me pause is the new skill cost inflation mechanic. Everyone is using the 2% atm... But if you're playing for say, 25 days, and earning 50 SPs a day, which is 2500 total.Those first 3 levels that aren't very efficient cost 6% inflation, which means they end up costing 150 points over time. So really the cost of each skill is quite a bit higher than the 2,5,10,20,30 it is atm. It's more like 30+ points per skill, even for the levels 1 to 3. This is the part that really bothers me.

ideas-feedback,Efficiency skills favour higher levels | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2991/efficiency-skills-favour-higher-levels,1269,5,5,DeadSchism,"I think the cost inflation should be done for individual skill trees. Instead of investing allot of points into survival for the early game then realizing skills in carpentry are extremely high cost even for the first level, have them calculated by tree so higher level skills in survival cost more points while your basic skills in any other tree aren't affected right off the bat. The system now is setup to make players feel like they need to be a jack of all trades which in turn encourages a solo play style rather than the team based survival game it was advertised to be. By no means am I saying this will solve that problem, but it should help to ease the suffering when picking late game skills like electronics, industry, and computer science doesn't require you to wait 3 days just to have enough skill points to spend on a single skill and having to get hit with more inflation costs as you specialize in that particular tree due to having to get so many prerequisite skills before it."
ideas-feedback,More Active Players | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3026/more-active-players,1085,4,1,ExPLiCiT,One of the main issues I find with this game is having enough players. I have seen a lot of people complain about the same thing and I think there is one simple change that could be done to help improve this substantially. I have like 85 players on my server roster and I would say that at least 15 have been very active players at one point but what I am finding as a server administrator is that each time I upgrade to the latest version of software I lose a good majority of my regs. This is a very bad thing particularly considering this game is in alpha and updates are released all the time. My recommendation to solve this is to change the server browser to display all servers regardless of what version they are running by default and if you MUST have a way to filter them out embed it a bit so it takes a couple of actions to implement it. This way when the player goes onto the server list to join their server it hasn't just disappeared and when they go to join it offer them a pop up that gives them some brief instructions on what they need to do to upgrade.

Currently in the Alpha 6 staging build we've added a 5% increase in all skills for each skill level a player has. This means when a player has purchased 20 skill levels, all other skills will be twice as expensive. The idea is to encourage players to focus on a more narrow range of skills rather than picking up a bunch of low level skills just because they're cheap while still allowing newer players the ability to pick up the skills they need at a reasonable cost. These changes are not necessarily going to end up in the final build of A6, but something in a similar vein will. This exact topic has come up in the past and we’ve received a lot of interesting feedback on the subject (especially when we changed the skill costs and changed the food nutrition). Ideally, I would love to get feedback on the current state of skills as they exist in A5.6 and any issues you think may arise from the changes that will end up in A6."

I have said in the past that making the game mechanics to force people to do things how you the developer think it should be is a bad idea. Incentives are a way to get people to specialize and like it. Make the skill trees for each profession more in depth and deeper. at the end is where the best of the best items are and midway is the good stuff and bottom of the tree is preparing for later in the tree. I'm so far seeing a need for 4 people to live right next to each other and each one is basically a slave on a farm tasked with an individual job. One hunts, one cuts wood, one digs the dirt out from a mine and the fourth picks away at the stone. 107 calories at 1st skill level is horrible and makes starting out difficult and a grind. This game is directed towards middle school aged children and so far everything you are doing is going to push away that age group. A teach is not going to realistically allocate enough time for students to do the grind needed to reach deep into the skill trees since progression is slowed down so much by the developers that your talking months to accomplish the goal of stopping the meteor.

If there are tons of 'skill gods' that have managed to specialize in everything, there will be no need for an economy. There's only so far you can take the skill tree content, we'll make it as deep as possible but it will always be finite, and thus without limiting the economy will eventually become obsolete. Thanks for the feedback, what level of skill specialization are you playing with?

If i may make a suggestion. I suggest instead of the skill points costing more overtime that you simply block out whole trees, but allow everyone to get the 1st tier in every tree and everything in one or two other trees. I.e. if you want to be a smith you research the whole tree that is involved in it, but you can still farm, hunt, gather etc etc but you wouldnt be able to say cook advanced recipes as a cook.  You could even have an admin server option that lets you pick by clicking on a box... 1 full skill, 2 full skills, normal mode. Keep both sides of the fanbase happy. I suggest this because i have tried it on a personal server with a few other people and it had good results for server size. I allowed people to specialize in 2 tech trees fully (opens up more gameplay for everyone while encouraging trade) i also allowed everyone to fully deck out the survival tech tree (allowed for everyone to do manual labor and not grind all the time) and also allowed them to learn one tech block in each tech tree (i.e. you could either learn the 1st level of carpentry or the 1st level of paper, not both) doing this allowed for the game not to become impossible if others werent on. You could still farm your own land and such, but not nearly as efficently as someone fully decked out in the farm tree. You could still cut boards, but someone specialized as a carpenter would use a lot less wood and be quicker. If you need any further explaining or help im here to ask"

With alpha 6 I did add the 'difficulty settings' which lets you decide how much skill specialization is needed, and we can experiment and see what feels good."

I would suggest not making the gathering skills such a pain to use. first level costs 1 skill point second costs 6 and it only reduces calorie consumption by 14%. that means for the first ~6 hours of gameplay it's grinding for food. And this is just for getting level 2 of a gathering skill such as logging.  That second level drops the calorie consumption from 107 to 92 so it's still a grind for food. No matter what food is always needed even in the later game, which is why I don't understand why it's so high when starting the game."

This way it will be more reflective with the current amount of players on the server. Currently I don't have a lot of active players and with the inflation rate there are several skills I can't unlock that are necessary to progress and there are not other players that I can either barter the skill scrolls from or buy the components I need. This ultimately brings a deadlock to progress.

Your proficiency (in this case inflation) raises two ways - in your main profession and multi-classed
So lets say You chose to be chef
You are a chef as main class, butcher as 2nd and farmer as 3rd
Chef skills 5, butcher skills 2, farmer skills 2
In this way increasing Chef skills from 5 to 6 will increase inflation for Chef skill points only - so it will cost you 6
But if You level cross class adding one more skill to butcher - from 2 to 3 - will cost amount of skills You have +1 so in this case (5+2+2)+1 -> to level up butchery from 2 to 3 will cost You 10, while leveling Chef from 5 to 6 will cost you 6.

Long Bow

With the new patch player interaction has really increased and people have become more specialised and its great step in the right direction but I feel the game is lacking economics and the sort of governmental side.
Firstly I'm not sure how much of an impact a president has over the game and would like it to be a greater role and let leaders be a president for more than 1 day as reelections can happen daily (serve a term be like 3-4 days), also I can't seem to make a law which cancels out another a red bar seems to appear when trying to vote this kind of law. 1st idea. So this my idea to implement a sort of pvp to enhance presidency and actually have a criminal system. (which I understand you are working on)
Let's suppose you have a new skill tree within survival called weaponry or whatever. The first skill unlocks, for example, a knife.  This knife increases a variable, lets call it power. This is eco, I don't think people hitting with each other with weapons is appropriate so this power is a passive variable.  Let's say a person who has researched this skill and wants to become a policeman or a vigilante and they have a weapon lets say a taser of 15 power this person can detain anybody with power lower than 10, a person with a power 40 people can detain people of power 35 or less. To detain someone they must be within a certain radious and if the person logs out to escape they leave a shadow of where they logged out where they can be detained. When a person is detain if there is a prison a sentence time can be set, if not there will be a small base time where the person is frozen, (making an allocated prison useful for a just variable punishment). I suppose the whole idea of lawbreaking has already been sketched out so I don't my ideas to overlap in that respect. To the idea of governments... I'd like to introduce the idea of dictatorships, regardless of election times a person can declare a coup and become a dictator, the voting system is the same as a normal presidency except instead of each individual giving their single vote their vote is weighted by their power (power is based on the strongest weapon a user holds IN their inventory) so if a dictator with a good weapon (say 40 power) and a supporter with another good weapon (say 30)  that means even if 10 people with a power 5 weapon could not oppose the dictator, (once they gained enough power they could overthrow the dictatorship.) Therefore we can have new political tensions and what not which would hinder progress, (a new obstacle to destroying the meteor). This skill tree is going to be hard to research so people don't start declaring dictatorship on day 1, plus as knives are a free item when u research 1st tier (like an axe) for you to win 10-1 through power you would have to research a lot and have player cooperation (to get a good weapon) making it hard for trolls to abuse this system. If the leader had more power, a person who has few supporters but wants to make a difference, you never know could be a GOOD difference could become a leader through dictatorship. Next idea is food. The max now is 72, a little low but I can't find a combo higher than 69 (no joke intended).  That could be raised a little but its a nice overhaul to what it was, though id like to make the max 100 as there isn't too much difference between some foods (currently nutrient-wise). Now for the advanced cooking and molecular stuff I know it isn't completed as ofe 6.03 but hear me out. If Eco is aiming for realism so should the food. In this day an age food is mass produced and the quality isn' necessarily as good as it was. So for the final stage of cooking, I think the meals should see a slight decrease in nutrition, but for preptime and resources much lower so it's REALLY EASY to make. So chefs can decide to make good food (30 nutrition stats) for few people or goodish (20-25 nutrition stats) FOR MANY. So maybe make the good food like BEAR S U P R E M E and Sweet Salad a little harder to make but make the advanced cooking food dead easy to make (with less nutrition). Also with the food topic, make some fish meals! Fish cakes, sushi, fish pie... We are also currently missing foods that are high in carbs fat and protein but low on vitamins (9 carb, 9 protein, 9 fat, 2 vitfood would be nice). Any people have ideas after 6.03? If any of my thoughts are confusing I can clarify!"

Because as You see there are some groups of people that will boost each other and in the end, single players will not be able to opress their power.

It would also be nice to see a method of town planning for buildings (e.g. build a Ghost version in an area that has been pre-designated for the building that has to be approved by a planning committee of sorts), I think that having something in this vein would make it easier to keep a ""design"" or feel for a town consistent."

Trap the land you wanted until they gave up/died then take the land. Gov helps that by making areas that can't be blocked in eg roads. You just have to get a gov setup and get communal planning. If it's a completely solo game you want then unfortunately you either have to play on a private server or deal with griefers alone. No two ways about it. Griefers are easier to deal with as a group than solo.

With a few simple added tools it could become very customizable, further it’s depth and precipitation/interest. Firstly regions, for this to work properly you need to be able to define regions. This could be quite easy, draw an area on a map (The tools already exist to do so) and name it and then put it up to a vote. If passed that region becomes a legal zone. With regions comes regional laws, laws that affect only certain areas. This is perfect for protecting the environment while allowing people to progress as you can create preservation zones, define where people can mine and cannot, create areas where you can build in order to push players together helping form communities. The list goes on. If you want to keep a global president you can limit the kind of laws regions can pass in order to protect the sovereignty of the global president. Thirdly the ability to make certain laws that affect certain areas only votable by people who live in that zone. E.g. if player owns land in zone A then allow vote on this law. This allows people to form communities that are different from others, which adds an entire other dimension as it introduces the need for diplomacy with other regions and the ability to decide where you want to live not just based on resources but on laws. Building on the idea of balancing progress and environment as you want to protect the environment but not drive people out. Thirdly the choice of representative democracy, with the added need for diplomacy with other regions, more ‘complicated’ law choice and ability to build real communities comes a law system that requires more attention than it usually gets in Eco. The choice of electing representatives to vote on laws instead helps lift the ‘burden’ off everyone and onto a few who want to focus on it which should help make the law system used more. As a side note adding regions that can be legally defined lays the path for other features such as new voting systems e.g first-past-the-post or more complicated taxation system."

for an explanation look at this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMsF1P-_vWc we all know that tailings are useless for anything besides ruining the environment but considering the aim of this game i think that's wrong because they need to be recycable one way to make them recyclable would be to add some mid/late game machines which can extract small amounts of ore and coal or biomaterial from the tailings but this process should be very expensive so that it's not going to be a profitable thing to do just like in the real world if it's made like this especially the expensive part then there's going to be a way to use tailings and reduce polution and with the new lawsystem that's coming up in 0.6 it will also be another way to use laws to benefit the world and change the way people use tailings an example would be a law that gives you something when you recycle tailings thereby encouraging people to recycle instead of just hiding the ""trash"" in the earth or a law taht punishes you for using a process that doesn't recycle tailings i hope to see this implemented at some point because i think it's going to help this game become what it's meant to be which is a reallife simulator on how to save the world

ideas-feedback,tailings cradle to cradle | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2826/tailings-cradle-to-cradle,1258,2,2,Mog,"I like the concept of recycling. But I don't like it much for tailings. The thing with real life tailing is they are a real pile of crap you don't want to deal with. As is said in your video, if you aim for recycling you should think about it when you are creating the product, it makes it a lot easier. Tailings are supposed to be the opposite of that, it's a bunch of really bad crap the producer never intended to recycle. Of course it might be possible to do something about it, but the thing is, it's a video game with video games mechanics. So if you make it salvageable, then they really won't be much of a problem. The player just have to build a couple of tables, let it run overnight, and no tailings anymore.
So I wouldn't like it mid game. And late game it wouldn't be really useful because everybody is using the blast furnace already. Unless you make the blast furnace produce some tailings too, then we're talking. I would like to see other wastes introduced. some kind of plastic wastes for instance. Now that durability is a thing, you could introduce a bunch of items that get broken and can't be fixed. And then you have to deal with them or they just fill up tons of space in your chests forever. If you make them not stack I'm sure they could be fairly annoying. And then make the player decide if he want to burn them for cheap, maybe even produce energy with it, but pollute a lot. Or if he want to recycle them by a long process, that takes energy and a lot of space. That would be interesting. Also on a side note. I don't now where that video comes from,. But what kind of people put a trademark on what they sell as an ecologic principle? I'm a bit puzzled."

If trees destroy things then trees are a hazard and must be eliminated in the eyes of the player. If I let trees grow around my fields somebody could cut one and I lose my crops. They also are annoying around roads as they block cycles. So in game there is an incentive to shovel up all the trees and put roads and concrete everywhere.

This should burn more calories... there should be a way to Un-notch an arrow without firing... maybe I just haven't figured it out... but I don't think there is. I also don't like that the unused animal products disappear.  Bone meal could be ground into fertilizer, obviously the fur and skin could have a use, feathers, claws, teeth... all could have a use.   My Character might not know how to Tan but my character would know that the parts are useful? Also, Hunting and Domestication of Dogs goes hand in hand.   I would like to see perhaps people who use Snares, from my Rabbit snares idea get a Wolf problem, LOL  And then perhaps they could start domesticating them."

Which if fine, it's pretty tough in reality, but it causes me to always end up with Elk, even when I am trying to go out and get anything else, it is just exponentially easier to get elk. Anyway In the real world If I were looking to hunt a rabbit and I had a bow, and a hand full of fibers I could make into rope.  I would hunt rabbit with a snare.  With wild Turkey, wild Turkey eventually stop and eat... they don't just go mach 10 all the time.  I Got a wild turkey but I had to chase it shooting arrows...  not how a person would do it in the real world.   You should be able to use lures for Turkeys, just toss some seed on the ground perhaps?  Then if/when the Turkey comes to the Lure it would stop and peck the ground, giving the player time to shot it. About the Snare.  I was also thinking abandoned or lost snares would make a animal avoiding area if the animal is left to rot, or the animal could be taken by a predator, which in turn could increase predator numbers... Anyway, I am enjoying the hunting, I like how the Bison really needs 2 players to be taken down easily.  I have gotten a couple alone just by stubbornness but good move to getting people to work together. A good way to play on the above...

ideas-feedback,A few observations and feedback.. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2721/a-few-observations-and-feedback,1507,5,1,CMS47,"I recently purchased this game and have been enjoying it thus far. However, I've noticed the hares don't seem to be having their aggro radius adjusted by the skill that lets you get closer while hunting.  I have a /ton/ of hares on my server but only see them rushing off at great distance when I do spot them, despite having leveled up the skill to get closer.  The other animals respond as they should, but not hares. So, I think the aggro radius of hares needs to be checked and adjusted. Second, when setting up chests in my house, I noticed the range for storage sharing is very limited.  I have two chests in a room with a workbench and research table and had to put a stockpile very close to that side of the house for the tables to share the inventory in them.  I placed a third chest in another room, on the opposite side of the house, and it's not able to be shared with either of the other two or the crafting stations or stockpile. So, I think the share range should be increased a bit, so that you don't have to limit the size of your house based on where you want to place chests. Finally, the minimap causes massive lag.  So much so that I can't keep it open and even hope to move around and this is with settings turned down. For that last one, I understand things aren't all optimized, so that might be the reason.  Still, I thought I'd mention it. :) Thank you for a fun game and I look forward to whatever's coming next with it!"

This post is for mainly SLG, but please feel free to debate/chime in/whatever. Been testing and getting ready for 5.6 this week and found something that has made me, as a player, sad. One fo the new changes it that the tables now force players to use the needed materials for the room. One of the things I love to do is when I am able to make new building materials is update my house. Now, unless for some odd reasons I want to put logs in my brick house I can not have certain tables.  But, in the real world, no one had to 'have' Logs in a building's material to make it work. As a Game Programmer myself, I understand the need for 'tiers' to make the players to use new items to get better stuff. So how to fix this? I understand the need for having X Materials to have a crafting tables so all I am really asking for is a very simple fix. Just give the materials a variable let's call it Material Rank(or MR) and have like Logs be 1, Lumber 2, Mortar 3 Brick 4 etc. Now.. when it checks the room, it will count each MR, and see if same or better than needed. Let's say we want an Oven in our house. You need 32 Mortar, so the room should check if the player has 32 items with MR 3 or better. Each room is already checking each material, list it and how many are in there, so a simple logic formula would be easy to add. If there are 100 logs, the room's RM is 1 if there are 50 logs, 50 bricks then the room has 50 rank 1 and 50 rank 3. The room would allow anything need rank 3 or lower that need 50 or more of that materials. If you had 100 logs and 30 bricks and 2 polished steel, and an Oven(needs 32 rank 3 or better) the room would see 30 rank 4 and 2 rank 6 and allow the Oven to work in that room. Thoughts?"

Me as a player and thinking like a true designer, I would think SLG would want us to upgrade our houses/crafting place. Which is why I want it to be like it was before, where the crafting tables need X Material or BETTER to use that table."

The keys could also allow access to just certain rooms in the house or base that could belong to certain people.  Now you could do something the same way with butting down a deed for each room, etc but its not as realistic as keys and a bigger management hassle, and again once a deed gives access it gives total access and there are times that you don't want to do that.

Stores and currency are getting decent usage, but contracts in their first pass aren't being utilized that much.  Any feedback on how they work and changes for the next iteration would be great. The goal with contracts is to be our 'quest' system: a new player can log in, and find the kind of work that's needed on the server from the economy viewer, and use that to determine what skills they specialize in.  It allows async cooperation not just for trading goods but for doing labor. Some things I'm planning on adding: a 'reputation' system which you can give and receive like currency, and lose if you have a bad contract with someone.    It can serve as an informal way of helping out before currency is active. I also want to re-add store-credit, which will connect with shared inventories, so you can trade at a store for credit, then spend it at a fee-charging craft table nearby. I'd like to add road building as a contract as well. I think with some additions and tweaks this could be a really powerful and fascinating system."

While a few other players like to solo and not bother helping, or asking for help. Side note. Maybe instead of skill points they get a title? I was also thinking about making items/clothing to somehow help with the 'quest' of the contracts. It could range from increase time limits, to increase carrying weight during time limits.

ideas-feedback,Contracts and Labor Market | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2466/contracts-and-labor-market,3030,11,3,toxxikz,"I think this is a good idea.  one think I would like to see is that the currency on the server gets set to one currency...... to many people making their own makes it difficult, you have to use this currency at this shop and this currency at this shop, its no different than just using credit at the store since no one else is using that currency. Honestly earlier in the game it would be nice if we could pay with rewards for completing a task.  Say I want a building built, here is the brick and here is the location....that is already in the game, but before currency there really isn't much you can do for the person.  It would be great if I could say once you have completed this building that you receive 10 wild Stew and 30 bricks. Another type of contract I would like to see added is a delivery contract, but different than what is there, what is there states bring me 30 wood you get paid, but what about move 200 iron ore from location A to location B.   I usually find that places I am getting ore from are quite far from my house and it can take hours to transfer the ore from the mine back to the house, if I could setup a depot at one location (my mine)for them to pick up from and have them deliver it to another (my house) that would be great, but be able to pick up the contract from either location..... maybe make depots linked to the owner and have shared contracts but not shared inventory over large distances. I also noticed that you can setup a contract to go build in an area, you give them the brick and let them go build, but if they don't build it you do not get the brick back, it just kind of defaults to well an incomplete contract but the person got the brick they wanted, and probably used it somewhere else for themselves.  I think there should be penalties for not completing a contract.  Maybe have their deed to their land put up as collateral until completed, and if it goes incomplete in that time the deed then becomes the owner of the contracts, and they can then sell you back your land and property or they can barter with you to complete the contract to get the deed back."

How about a mechanism for exchange - like an exchange bank?  People on our server have liked the idea of 'different' towns and would like to see that broadened to where different towns would have different mayors as they already can have different currency.  There would have to be some way for the server to know what currency was worth what, of course, probably from looking at what stores were charging for items and contracts and figuring it out from there, then enabling a ""exchange bank"" where you can take one currency and exchange for another and then go and buy in the town that uses that currency?"

If the quest is completed, the 'quest giver' pays them with either items or currency(if they have it) as well as the game giving them ""XP"".

Very good job. For those who don't know what I'm talking about, imagine that the minimap is a globe of earth.  Put yourself at the equator.  Now 'walk' north until you pass the north pole and all the way until you hit the equator again.  That's 180 degrees.  Now you're looking at the equator, but 'upside down'.  South is 'up' from this perspective.  Now, walk back to your starting point, and this time walk 180 degrees west.  On a sphere, you're looking at the same place you visited before, but with North 'up' this time.  On ECO's torus, those excursions visit completely different places.  Also, on ECO's torus, you're never 'upside down' with respect to any of the maps.  And, the 2-D square maps map perfectly onto the 3-D world.  No worries about worries about weird 2-D map projections.  And, the compass never flips (like when you cross the magnetic pole on Earth)  That's confusing to some players.

While I think this game has some serious potential, one of the largest drawbacks in the current Alpha is the lack of players. One of the selling points of the game is to promote and establish co-operation between players on a small world with limited resources. The problem currently, IMHO, is that there are certain systems in place that dont promote the active playing of the game over the passive waiting of the game. The problem, so far, is the Skill system. There are two fundamental problems with the Skill system. The skill system really doesnt encourage players to actually be playing the game but managing a simple eating mechanic and logging out. Balance Diet, Maximize Daily Skill gain, log out and wait for skill points. Being logged out means no active playing. Its much more difficult to co-operate and co-ordinate with players not playing the game. In a game that is supposed to be about co-operation, this strangles gameplay immensely. A good point to reference is that it seems most servers have 50-60 ""citizens"" but always between 0-3 actual players at any given point. If you want to encourage players to be online, you need ways in which they can gain skills at the same pace that you wish skills to advance, but within the game. You want to encourage people to be actively, not passively playing the game. That gives greater chances for people to start talking and co-ordinating. The second problem is ""Jack-Of-All-Trades"". On one server I have been playing on, within 18-20 hours I was a Carpenter, Farmer and slowly working toward early Smithing. The problem with being able to go very route is that it doesnt encourage me to find someone who woodworks and ask them to make me a door or find someone who farms for food. It doesnt encourage economy. Its a safety system designed so inactive servers can sort of thrive. I am not sure if there are mechanics that make it harder to go multi-routes but you need ways to stop people from becoming, well, skill gods. Possibly a system where Skill costs increase in other paths as you invest down one. Ive been reading the forums and these small group, jack of all trades situations pop up in a few conversations."

Skills do go up at the same rate online or offline, and it is challenging having to wait for skill gain.  The goal is to let brand new players try a little bit of each kind of profession, but as the server advances to make a real contribution you'll have to pick a branch and stay with it. As for actively vs passively playing the game, we have a lot of features oriented towards asynchronous play (stores, chat logs, contracts forthcoming) and I'd like to expand this. With a well organized economy in the game, you should be able to do quite a lot of interaction even with offline players. I'd also like to leave the door open for multiple kinds of play.  You can really get a lot of time in the game and build roads between cities, huge buildings, things that are needed for the game. Or, you can take a less time-intensive but still important route like research, where you're the organizer for the project, setting up stores and contracts, trades, transports, etc in order to manage the production and logistics of a large research project.  Less time intensive but still valuable.  It's a very tricky challenge to design a game that lasts 30 days but avoids 'grind', and this is our experimental approach. Lots of new stuff we're trying in this game so it will definitely take some iteration time to get it solid.  Feedback like this is super valuable. Thanks a ton Diosys and keep it coming."

""a skill system idea"", If we want to bring people to gather as a coop thing best way to do that is like in real life with education, for example if every one can do everything but you only get better at something with time by doing it, then could create a situation where people could pass on those improved skills to other people with experience boost so. so you have a baker for example with a skill of level of 80% and someone else has a skill level of 1% but that person wants to be better quicker with out all trail and error that person with 80% could write books and put them in a school, then the person with 1% could go to school and read that book to get a experience bounce towards that skill. a system like that would at least bring people to gather to help each other even if there not online at same time, it would also help people not fall to far behind every one else. the only way to tackle jack of all trade issues is to add so many diff types of passive skills and ability that it is impossible to get 100% in them all before x goal in game happens, but that would also allow people who turn that event off to play game with smaller amount of people. so it would force people to come to gather little more for meteor event and allow people who want to solo and just world build that ability also. also add on option for server, me and my friends for are smaller games would also love to see a pause feature for server so if there is no one on the world it pauses the game - that could be turned on and off."

The solution as I've imagined it is to let single player and small groups 'fast forward' the server, so they can get more skill points to become experts in all fields, but to leave the default, non-fast forwarded game as the primary focus, which requires using the government and economy features of it. The problems you face in the game are social challenges (climate change, pollution) and require social tools (economy, government), I think the game will still be interesting and fun without multiplayer but there should definitely be a lot added from it, and 'dealing with people' is meant to be a big challenge of the game that we give you tools for.

hitting on the government stuff - it be little more realistic if the government aspects where multiple cum-minty designed on same server,  in real life diff community have diff laws, if there was away to form zones into diff towns and then towns each could have there own gov mayor it would allow you to hit those challenges of trade - laws and working to gather on large scale between communities and with in each town but also it a may allow game to be tailed towards smaller communities also. at latter date in research there could be a UN style building where community leaders  come to gather and for community to communities trade could setup world trade guild each town could create a guild where that town comes to gather to trade on open global market place. I have feeling thought that skill system, research tree may get changed and added to a lot as road progresses. on our server we tend to slow down the time simulation so that skill points are handed out at around half the speed they are at now to encourage trade and building and it has for most part worked due to less skill points are handed out people have to specialize more so and that is even on a smaller server,  then we just in cress meteor time from 30 days to 120 days to allow our smaller community change to get tech level needed to stop meteor. the number of players currently on our server is 10 and this time management setup has worked well so far for every one for most part. other thing that is kind of weird is land markers - I like idea of research for there progressing but could be tied to a new skill tree like categorical which would be really neat skill have in this game to allow exploration and maybe maps and zoning. - which creating more skills like that would require people to not be able to specialize as quickly. on side note is it really cool how the developers respond back to the forms and highly appreciated. specially after the no man sky thing."

A more detailed analysis: Change ratios based on the time that has pass (on the server) in relation with the amount of players/active players in it. First, mark players based on their online activity. Example, let's say:
Tier 1: Active = 1 hour/day
Tier 2: Semi-Active = 1 hour / 2 days
Tier 3: not Active = 1 hour / 3 days
Tier 4: Inactive = Less than 1 hour / 3 days So, based on the above variable, you'll create a formula which Tier and Time its variables. So, let's say: On the start of day 8: If T1 =< X1 (where X1 is the number of active players per server, on average), then change Skill ratio by Y%. On the start of day 15: If T1 =< X1 and T2 =< X2 and T3 =< X3 etc, then change Skill ratio, etc. You get the concept. After the end of each week, the players would be informed of any difference in the skill gaining ratio. This will also help players to not abandon relatively empty servers that they feel invested into them, since the skill gaining balancing will make it viable for them to be able to reach the late phase of the game."

Been finding this myself and, as a part of server with only Content Creators, we're all very interested in the cooperation aspect of the game, only to find that the game doesn't lend itself to that as much as we'd hope... One thing would be to fix the cart/collision bugs, which would allow easier movement of materials, hence empowering stores/trades. That is a BIG limitation right now. The collision bugs are annoying (i.e. player to wall/ground/etc) but the cart bugs are actually very limiting to trade and effective movement of resources. I would suggest rails+rail carts: much more effective mining/distribution solution. Second thing, and I have mentioned this in another post, is the ability to send work orders to a player even if they are offline. This requires the currency system to be fully implemented: RFP sent, offer received, work order submitted. Along with the work order and train/rail system, I think that skill books shouldn't be transferable. This promotes cross-pollination of skill trees, which diminishes the value of ""working for them"" and selling your services (vs your skills). I'm going ""long"" on this game. There's a lot of potential and the developers seem to be eager and willing to work with the feedback they have received. Fingers crossed for a speed up in the development (especially bug fixing)... ;) I do believe that this game is being marketed as a ""multiplayer experience"" and I think that is its strength.

I suggest that while online you gain the sp/day at the normal rate, but when offline that it is reduced to half. Personally I am getting tired of being one of the few on the server doing things while others log in eat and log off till the next day.  This is frustrating, they are gaining way more skill points per day than me because i cant afford to eat the better food as I am spending calories.  After a week someone who logs in each day for a few minutes, grabs their beans, huckleberries and beets, starts 8 wild stew, eats two and logs off gains 108 skill points a day and has that to spend each day.  I am working at mining and getting ores and such and burn through calories way too fast to support a wild stew diet so I usually just eat corn while i'm mining and stay at about 20 skill points per day.  I eat wild stew before logging off but after I have been on for 8 hours i have lost a considerable amount of skill points compared to the people that just log in long enough to eat.  after a week or so the people who only logged in to eat have way higher efficiency than me because they weren't even playing or contributing. I don't think the people that aren't on contributing should be rewarded more than the ones actually playing and contributing.  I think lowering the sp/day gain while offline by 50% or even by 75% would encourage more people to be on more.  This would also have the effect that they will  be spending more calories and not always eating the better foods so they would need to focus more where they spent the skill  points and would help to encourage a more co-op play style without having a large impact on smaller population servers where players tend to be on a lot already. I mean the other thing that could be done but would not be as easy is to actually change the way skill points are gained.... I mean come on eating healthy doesn't make me better at carpentry, actually doing carpentry and getting practice does.  I like the skill points for learning a new skill, but for the efficiency i believe that should come from doing.  if i am a carpenter and i eat good food but never made a board i can still max the efficiency..... i mean in real life you learn how to make a better board and use less materials by actually doing, trial and error.  But like I said that would need to be a complete overhaul, that while maybe would be more realistic would take  a long time to make those changes and we are still in alpha so I would not expect it to have developed this far yet. Also shout out to the devs love the game its great especially at this stage, and i know its a challenge to balance it but would love to see more co-op encouragement in the play style....even if you lock people to certain skills until they put 75% of the available skill points for that skill tree into it, but then again that would require removing the requirements such as lvl 4 masonry to learn smithing, but you could make them need to get 10 of each ore instead of needing ore and stone.... more focused in the career path, but allow the server admin to determine if they would use a locked skill tree setup or not as some smaller population servers this would be a hindrance and the traditional model may work better.... or allow the admins to set the percentage you must spend in each skill tree before being able to learn a new one...this would allow smaller population servers to set it to 0% and larger ones to set it at say 50% or 75%..."

The game has great mechanics for co op, a good economy system, but in most cases they are of no use because everyone can do everything and the skill gain mechanics of favors this.
I understand that developers do not want to add jobs so they do not limit players development but as it is, it's very easy to learn and do everything. An elegant way of getting around the situation without limiting the player development Is to separate skills by trees/categories and add a focus or study system. Why are you learning anything and gaining skills just by having a full belly?? It makes no sense
If you want to be something, you need to study and/or focus on it like in real life. With separate skill point for each tree or category we can choose what we want to learn in the next hours, days and the skill points can only be spent in the corresponding tree (That we are studying, focusing on) Each skill tree has a CAP, we can study this tree until it reach the skill cap.
At any moment we can change the focus/study just by clicking the button on the corresponding tree and the skill gain (online and offline) will be for this new tree.
In this way we will have to learn specific things plan the focus/study if we want to be or do something. A system like that does not limit the player development, everyone will continue to be able to be everything, but it will be a little more realistic.
While one studies butchering, the other studies something else. I can study agriculture while a friend studies cooking, I can also focus on or study and learn cooking, but my focus/study in agriculture will stop (pause). So the calorie will used to feed the brain that is focused on learning something ;) Just a visual mockup with buttons"

In you example there are points in carpentry points, in smithing.... but it looks like this player is a cook, why would they need carpentry and smithing, if others are doing those professions you trade with them for the items you need from that profession.  for smaller servers with very few people on  them i can understand but honestly you need a way to make the person want to focus on one skill tree and not be using the others or maybe make it less desirable. How about you can still gain points as normal, but you have to select a focus, points spent in that focused skill are normal anything outside of that focus other than survival would cost 5 times the points to learn....but you get locked to that focus until that tree is either completely full or say 75% full then you can change focus.  Your idea has merits but still makes it easy for someone to switch focus and put points anywhere they want. If you don't find a way to allow the admins to actually decide to limit or not limit what the players have access too they will continue to just learn everything the same way, the only thing you do with this is say ah you need to look ahead and know what you want to do next.... most of them already do that."

As a masonry, you need to learn cooking to be able to craft a oven.... Why?  Oven should be a masonry skill and a mason does not need to know how to cook.
If they make a mason need to use something made by bakers to craft a oven, ok.
A baker can ""draw"" the blueprint of the oven and the mason can use that blueprint item to learn how to build a oven so it will works for bakers.
Window, door and basic things should be crafted at workbench, [basic craft] 1, 2 or 3  the same way it has board and chest, carpentry should make better and multiple versions of doors and windows. A focus system can work if they rearrange the tech tree here and there (With a slower skill gain as this is another problem, with super basic raw and campfire food you can gain a lot/day). I believe they don't want to add a job system(the best option.), then it is a bit useless to have so many interesting systems like economy because this is just for roleplay, there is no real use since it's easy to do everything. Another interesting way is the Ultima Online or Life Is Feudal Your Own skill system.
Your skill gain is limited to X (for example 750) and you decide what to do with your points.  You can master a skill tree and learn the basics of other skills.
In the server configuration the skill CAP can be set.
In game the Town Hall could be used as respec system.
Paying X(definer by the leader/server admin), you get your points back and can redistribute."

Why?"" I had stated ""but then again that would require removing the requirements such as lvl 4 masonry to learn smithing"" This is another case of that, a mason doesn't need to learn how to bake to make an oven...... in real life the people that make an oven may not have any skill in using it, but they understand the concept behind it and can make one.... those type of restrictions need to be removed, but still have it so masons make the oven, you now have created a need for cooks to buy from a mason..... hence creating commerce and trade. also still not addressing the key of the game that is missing, in order to encourage commerce and trade people have to play, not log in eat and log off while waiting on skill gain..... only way to really fix that is make it more profitable to be online and reward the players that are online and contributing and not the people who log in eat and gain max skill points they can per day to increase efficiency to be able to actually play in two weeks while others are building the infrastructure and setting them up for success so they can pop in with max efficiency and then do what ever they want without the need of the other players who have been contributing the whole time."

Also at the start i can see where it can be a bit tough you don't have many skill points and there isn't much you can do, but unfortunately when people say that to me i have an answer, there is always something you could be doing.  Expand your house, redesign your house, gather plants for farmers to gain seeds, check out the world walk around, in a few hours you could have engineering and you could be building roads, or carpentry is pretty easy at the start.  If you can't find things to do early on in the game ask other players what they are doing, help them out join in, be a cooperative player.  start farming some ore or stone for when you do get those efficiencies up.

I wouldn't want to set this at a set percentage but an adjustable percentage by the admins as you are correct lower population servers or servers that are using the meteor may not want to lower the offline points, while some of the larger servers with many active players may want to use this to reward the active players so they do not feel disappointed when a player comes on buys food from an active player eats it and logs off, comes back each day does the same thing and in 2 weeks decides to become more active and has 3 times the skill points the active players have. Also if it is configurable the admin can have it at 100% gain while offline for say the first week then change it to 75% gain for the second and 50% for the third, they could adjust it to the needs of their specific server."

In my opinion this is a bad move. If I was personally the developer of this game I would be finding ways to promote it rather than to force it. I have noticed over the change over from 5.4 to 5.5 the force co-op is extreme. This is starting to ruin the game for me and many other who wish to help and see this game reach it's full potential. Bellow I will list some suggestions that would be a great advantage for the developers to consider, I hope others with ideas to promote co-op without killing small group play will post as well.

I don't think the bonus for being in the same area as someone else really makes sense either to be completely honest. The joining in to cut down craft time does sound like an interesting idea though, I think that could definitely be worked into the current system, but we'll have to see. The balance right now is being changed with every major patch (5.4, 5.5, 5.6 etc.) so we'll likely see a lot of changes to how everything works in the future. They're still testing things to see what fits best, so this is going to take some time. As for the ""forcing"" co-op, this game was originally intended to be used in education, to teach middle-schoolers how the ecosystem works, and that they need to work together. Releasing the game to public happened afterwards. I don't think making cooperation ""optional"" would be realistic, nor would it fit the theme of the game."

How this doesn't make sense to you is beyond me, maybe the area you live in has nothing but above ground utilities, but where I live it's commonplace to bury power cables and other utilities under the roadway. I'm not saying to make co-op optional, if you read closer to what I said, I said to find a creative way to promote the co-op. History has shown that forcing people to work together instead of finding creative ways to entice them the to work together has created failure. I understand that this is targeted towards educational purposes, but in a the eyes of an educator this system of forcing co-op may not work. Lets look towards this in a logical sense. a basic classroom will have 10 to 30 students. If for example only 5 students are allowed at a time to play the co-op style the game is pointing towards will drastically fail. I as much as you devs want to see this game succeed. Perhaps it's time for the devs to get together and take a second look and ask ""are we pushing to hard towards co-op?"" I have seen that in the latest staging that even survival skills are being pushed towards specializations, I can say this much if I login to a new server and I have to wait for someone else to chop my wood just so I can build a house you will loose a lot of support from the educational community."

They're heavily suggested unless you enjoy shoveling tons of rock, dirt, and other materials which, to be fair, some people actually enjoy. I would even argue that it has become more feasible to function in a solo capacity given the changes to the to unlock skills in 5.5, though it is at the cost of your own time. If we were actually trying to force it, we would simply take the suggestion to completely lock people out of trees once they've placed points in others. I'll also have to completely disagree with your assertion that the game doesn't function with less than 5 players. On the SLG server we essentially only have 3-4 players who actually play consistently and, while there are certainly hiccups in progress occasionally, we manage just fine. There's even someone on the server (not one of us) who is actually just solo completing everything, albeit at a slower rate than the group does. This isn't to say there aren't balance changes needed or that everything is perfect as-is, but saying the game will ""drastically fail"" with 5 players is a gross overstatement. As far as I'm aware, there were no large changes to the survival tree between the current release and the current staging (which is basically just bugfixes at this point); at least none that would drastically push it towards specializations. It would help if you could actually expand on what specifically you feel forces cooperation in the game."

I do understand it's a balancing issue but I was well as others I have spoken to believe that current calorie consumption is spot on. Currently at beginning of the game on a fresh server the fact that so much resources are needed for just your basic campfire cooking is unrealistic, this is forcing almost everyone to start off with pumping skill points into the campfire efficiencies taking away the  skill points that can be spent better on developing a good co-op base. once we reach the researching and it's time for the new skill trees, the required amounts of materials that are needed right off that bat is forcing that wedge into the groups to divide them up into different trees hence where the forcing co-op comes into play. I could think of many ways that would be better to approach this while making people feel that they are not being forced to specialize in certain areas. For example..... make the town hall an early game item instead of a mid game item, now add in a polling station item where players can see the different trees to specialize in, give the players the ability to choose ahead of time, that they would like to do this skill tree, now the players are not stepping on each others toes and thee or four people going for the same skill tree. Lets face it, children don't have the worlds best communicating skills. But if you provide a good system where there is a community center for people to collaborate with each other you will have people not feeling pushed in a certain direction. I understand that increasing the materials required for crafting is to simulate destroying the ecology, but lets face the facts of what it feels like to the players. It feels like you want to make us grind to achieve a success. without us players you would not have a gaming development business, and I as one of the players am trying to provide good feedback on what it feels like from your customer base. My son is middle school aged A.K.A. your target base. I have let my son play this game and he lasted one half hour before he stopped playing. I asked him why he stopped and his response was that he was tired of grinding away at trying to make food.

You can't make a game educational if you abandon the realism of it. I think that the high cost of materials at the start is quite realistic, and using efficiencies to encourage players to become more efficient in order to progress more smoothly is realistic.  Lets say in real life I am going to become a carpenter, I don't just go buy a drill and saw and automatically know how to make things that are high quality, it takes time and experience to get there.... that is what the efficiencies are simulating.  I personally would love to see efficiencies gauged more on the number of products that you produce rather than eat healthy and you become an expert at carpentry.... but this is still in alpha and there will be tons of changes still coming. As for food not providing enough calories.... The server admin can easily make changes to the food and allow them to provide more calories, this is a very simple fix for the server admin honestly.  As a server admin I have added more calories to the wild food so that people do not use up all of the wild plants at the start (which can be easy to do if you try to progress at a fast pace), but what I also did is drop the amount of skill points you gain from the starter foods.  I believe if your going to get more calories then you should get less skill from it, now i didn't drop it drastically  so say Huckleberries for example, they have very low calories but that is an easy fix. Huckleberries typically: private static Nutrients nutrition = new Nutrients()    { Carbs = 5, Fat = 0, Protein = 0, Vitamins = 15};
public override float Calories                          { get { return 70; } }
public override Nutrients Nutrition                     { get { return nutrition; } } Suggested changes: private static Nutrients nutrition = new Nutrients()    { Carbs = 5, Fat = 0, Protein = 0, Vitamins = 12};
public override float Calories                          { get { return 120; } }
public override Nutrients Nutrition                     { get { return nutrition; } } As you can see its a simple change, a few less skill points for more calories, not a drastic change but the server admin can makes these changes to any of the foods if they wish they are all in the Mods\AutoGen\Food folder. You as and admin can also change the EcoSim.eco file for any plant that you want, you can make them spread more or increase the number that are created in an area. (if you don't know how use the forums ask, there are plenty of people willing to help you) I understand it can feel a bit like a grind at first.... but honestly have you ever chopped down a tree... it takes time its not 5 hits and it falls and it is a lot of work you burn a lot of calories.... while some people may not like these aspects others may find that it is more realistic and while you may have a short grind at the start there is value found in hanging in there and progressing to where you are more efficient.... anyone who doesn't think that is an educational lesson in itself maybe just wants things handed to them and doesn't want to work for their rewards. This is an alpha and things will change time and time again but i understand where everyone is coming from and it is good to provide this feedback, no Dev expects to hear they thought of everything and made a perfect game right out of the gate.  Every Dev I know wants constructive criticism so please keep letting everyone know how you feel and you never know maybe someone can bring to light something for you that you did not know.... like every server admin can change the calories on any food they want at any time and have it applied with a simple restart....it does not require a wipe."

Real World Simulation inside Cyber via Fun Method which is Playing Games. Now get into what i want to say, which is i hereby i thank you the support team who talk to me and encourage me to post it here.
I wish this game can use some of the good point if i indeed pinpoint it, or what i said will bring some other idea unto surface. I did try this game for some time. THE CONCEPT is GREAT INDEED AND have a VERY LONG OR FURTHER AHEAD VISION.
Here is what exactly i said in the email with support team: Dear ECO, Thank you for such respond and action.
Since ECO Support are being so nice.
If you dont mind, i leave a little comment on which part makes me unfit to the game currently and hope it is improved in the future. Regarding the skill tree window. Scrolling through the Skill tree in inconvinient.
I think it is great to make such skill tree, but i think it will look nicer if the skill tree changed into tab presentation per skill tree.
Example Survival into one tab then inside Survival divided into several skill maybe from left to right is easier in the player's eye and mind. If possible too, when we buy our lot.
It is hard to see which lot belong to us without walking back and forth trying to find the coordinate.
It is great but it takes too much time to meddle and making slower for player to get into the core game.
If can, show colour or some way to differentiate the terrain under our lot certificate. The control for shoveling ground also hard and make me dizzy. since it is hard to control which terrain block we want to pick.
I cut the grass weed and it gives me grass seed but also weed that i dont know how to clean from my inventory.
If possible since the game have large or many feature. Make Tutorial that can guide gamers like in mobile game.
It will set them adjusted to the game until core game begin. Maybe that three things is most bothersome for me.
I am hoping the game get improved alot cause the concept is so great and what makes me commit into paying.
But it needs more polishing on the interface and presentation window.
I also hoping more tutorial in game that helps players get started in game quicker and get into the core game.
Which is competing against other player, economy or profession. Thank You ECO, please let me know through my email if there is any new update or info from ECO.
HOPING ALOT, IT GETS BETTER.
Keep it up. Hope its not too late to give this comment. Best of Luck to ECO."

Weather is definitely something they're going to be looking at, but they're working on other features at the moment. Boats and other water content will be added in a future update, nothing else is really known about this at the moment. There will probably be more animals and plants in the future. Customization will be a bit more opened up in 5.6, and probably even more in later updates. Running would be a neat feature to have, but I doubt it will come any time soon. UI will be reworked as the game progresses. The main focus at the moment is on content. Thanks for the great suggestions :D"

Dig higher up and then crouch to get that extra little bit of distance down so you can place a block further down is really handy. Or your having a hard time clicking something at a angle below you crouching makes that easier. Just my two cents.

I think it's a nice idea for lower tech servers or folks that have bulk product to sell but don't want to put it all in a cart and then find a shop that's buying it.  it makes it so you can make a shop and then bring it closer to high traffic areas, maybe even setup an impromptu market location where everyone brings their stalls and hawks their goods.  as for game balance have it cost the same or a bit more than a wooden cart with the added need for a store on the materials.  in every other way have it function the same as the cart.  I just don't like that you have to build a room in order to setup a shop and especially if you're in the boonies it cuts out unnecessary steps and helps with the flow of the economy.  as a possibility have it on a timer of up to 24 hours after being ""deployed"" it auto reverts to its cart state.  that way permanent shops still have their uses and if you want to sell lots of goods or something it's better to make an actual building with the shops inside.  thoughts or criticisms?"

So pollution, deforestation, killing wildlife are just some of the great threats to our lovely world, and something that needs planning for not to take a grave toll on, which obviously is what this game is about, however I think it would add another dimension to the game, to add technologies of different kinds to minimize the pollution from industry even more, as we see in real life. Mechanics like crafting filters to minimize the impact of co2 pollution from chimneys, plant algae as an alternative source for either food, eating co2, use weed for fiber, clothes,  solar panels for power and yeah you get the idea. Also I would love simple features as being able to sit down in chairs etc, while this does nothing mechanically for the game, it does add to the entire roleplay aspect of it. Maybe even add beds and physical exhaustion besides calorie deficit. I am not trying to make it to a new minecraft, because it's not, but it would add to the realism of this simulation."

In fact, I think they should make it so that there should be NO connection until you check or click a button that allows it.   That way, you can have the server be on lock down until your ready.  This should be the first thing it does every time you boot up the server.  AKA Another setting that would be nice is ""Broadcast to Serverlist"" setting.  Where the server does not show up on the server list UNTIL you tell it it's time to.  That way you can fully configure the server FIRST.  You then can have the lockdown feature help control connection until then.  Now if broadcast to serverlist is turned off then lockdown wouldn't really matter as it wouldn't show up even to the public serverlist.  Now if you know the server IP you could do a quick connection check etc.  doing it this way. My thoughts."

One of the biggest support headaches we have is that people hit the ""start"" button, jump in the game, immediately see the server and jump in.  2 things happen - they see a desert world and the world is trying to generate with a player in it and the CPU goes more crazy then usual.   Then they decided the only way to fix it is to delete the world and restart it.  The bad news is that somewhere they have gotten the information that the only way to start a fresh world is to re-install the server (or that instruction is the first that pops up when they google) so they hit the install button and that blows away all the nice configuration data we had set up for them....and the server has to go through an install and they were doing this over and over  - we finally had to remove the option from Eco Server owners to re-install a server.  We had instructions for them to just click the big Icon that say ""reset world"" but they did not see that :)  or that they could just delete Game.eco.  Now they have to look a little further and click the icon or delete the file.  BUT that does not solve the issue because they do the same thing.  I had a guy the other day spend 4 hours ""trying"" to get a world going after buying a server (and before sending in a support ticket) recreating a world from fresh every few minutes trying to get one that was not a ""desert"".  And it kind of plays havoc with the CPU to have a fresh world generating over and over again like that.  He finally sent in a ticket furious that his world was like this and blaming the server for the problem.  I can understand his frustration in assuming that the game would not let him in if the world was not complete yet and making him think that each world he built was broken.  I have had several just this week come in discord and ask what to do about ""desert"" worlds.  Also,  it used to be that if you logged in when the world was generating it would still generate.  I was getting told this week that people had logged in and it was ""desert"" and when I explained that was because their world had not completed generating yet they said okay but came back like an hour or so later asking 'how long should it take'.  They ended up deleting that world and generating a new one - staying out of it until it was done and then they were fine.  SO, especially if logging in now causes a world in the process of generating to fail, there needs to be a way to block logons until that generation is complete  It is important, of course to keep a server ""private"" until the admin is ready to ""release"" or ""open"" it but I think that any login should be blocked until the world is completely generated.  The question is does the world know when its generation is complete?  Earlier version it seemed like, and it may have been coincidence that Game.eco  was not written until generation was complete but since 5.0 (and maybe sooner) Game.eco is written and the world if you log in is not populated with trees, plants, animals etc.  I used to just wait to go in until I saw Game.eco but that is no longer the telltale factor anymore.  I can tell from watching the CPU and see it drop down and stay down and stabilize that the world is done generating but not all new server admins are that savvy.  I guess the first question is does the server know when generation is complete?   Then,  can the server block logons and can it keep the block until it gets the notification that the generation is complete?"

Whether at the store or at the depot, I was thinking it'd be great for people to send requests in. They go to the depot or store, and request, for example, a ""powered cart."" Then when you log on, you see the request, and you either choose to accept, deny, or alter. Alter means you're going to set certain parameters where they pay for half up front, or they provide all building materials, etc. You can alter the price etc. Once that happens, it sends a notification to the requester, and they can accept, deny, or alter. TO avoid the loop of unending alters, there should only be one alter for the requester and two alters for the builder. Secondly, a note section in the store. The ability to type a note that someone can say ""hey, i stopped by, saw you didn't sell this, could you sell this?"" as a way to help the storeowner when he's offline."

ideas-feedback,ECO EULA | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2264/eco-eula,1879,5,1,mickhatesgames,"Hello, my name is Mick and I am here to advocate that strangeloopgames creates an EULA for ECO that protects the future of ECO servers. First off, I would like to explain where I come from on this topic. I have played the game Minecraft for years. I played it from it's indev versions through alpha, beta, and the current release. Since Minecraft has sold I believe around 120 million sales, I would like to think that many of you would be familiar with the game. If not, that is fine because the main component to the game I would like to stress is how the multiplayer works. It works very similarly to ECO's in a sense that any individual can launch a server for anyone to play on. The servers can also be modded. On the mechanics side of things, the only draw back was really anytime a server owner wanted to control some aspect of the game that Mojang did not anticipate and did not provide configuration for. Otherwise, servers ran smoothly. The downfall of the pleasant Minecraft community is in the freedom that was given to server owners to sell in game success to it's players. Mojang eventually realized this, and began requiring all servers be play-to-win instead of pay-to-win through restrictions in it's EULA. This measure however failed, not because an EULA isn't a powerful measure against pay-to-win, but because they issued it after they accidentally allowed the entire Minecraft user base to become used to and comfortable with pay-to-win. Lead by server owners, players continue to resist any changes Mojang/Microsoft makes to end pay-to-win servers. Hopefully for the sake of those that play Minecraft, more and more servers will abandon pay-to-win as some already have, but for me--I am moving onto other games. This brings me to ECO, a far better game that I am happy to see is still in alpha and I look forward to playing it through the many versions to come. I have very limited experience in the game because I just bought it. I have however, gotten a feel for some of it's community and I love it. The helpfulness and enthusiasm for the game is very much what I have needed. Definitely brings me back to when I first started playing Minecraft as I cannot deny some of the similarities. I believe that their is a shared understanding of the fun a player ran economy brings. I think the most enticing feature of the game is that through teamwork, planning, and fun hours played you can achieve a lot. I fear that these things can be taken away if clever server owners trying desperately to increase their player-base slowly finds more and more ways to give donators an edge, unknowingly sacrificing their economies and game plays for an expanding server. Server owners after all are just players all the same, they are not evil--they are just trying to be successful in creating a large server for the game. The opportunity to prevent this is now, and it is only a matter of time before this window closes for good. A EULA for eco would work if created in time. You can't stop players from trying to make large, wonderful servers (and you shouldn't), but you can influence how they do it. If from the beginning you make a clear set of rules preventing pay-to-win servers, they will never be tempted to add such features to their server to be able to expand it. If they are tempted to break such a rule, then you simply shut them down after a warning (add a feature to enable you to do so if you haven't already) and publicly post the shutdown so that everyone knows you are serious. As far as worries to enforce such rules goes, I think it would be very possible to do so. In addition to the shutdown feature, I believe in the power of community. Just as Mojang accidently created a community that fought to keep pay-to-win servers alive, you can create a community to make sure a pay-to-win server never makes it in the first place. Giving players the ability to anonymously report servers through a form that asks them to present the evidence (like links to a ""donator shop"" ect.) would encourage them to speak up. Publicly shutting down servers does the same. Most importantly, simply issuing these rules now protects the current servers by keeping them the norm; thus any new server with a pay-to-win feature is against the norm causing players to avoid it and report it. You must solve the issue before it arises to set the standard for the community, they are much more powerful in protecting play-to-win servers than you, as the game creator, will ever be. You must make the first impression that says ECO will be a game that all people can play together on equal grounds in the name of fun and education. Do not make it a game that teaches people money generates success. This is your opportunity to set the stage for ECO's multiplayer, do this and the community will not just buy your game, but help it grow in a healthy way and protect the things that make it great. If you don't do this, somewhere along the line, one server at a time, players will sell it's features to other players to help their own community grow rather than just improving their servers quality in itself. I know which one you would want, and I know the only reason you haven't done this yet is because you are either blind to it's need or you are unsure on how to enforce it. All I am asking you to do is send a message and make it bold. Follow through with the tools you need to enforce it a little and the community will do the rest. Hopefully if you do this early enough, you will never even have to use the shutdown function. With hope, Shaun ""Mick"" Coyne ign: MickHatesGames P.S.
For those of you unfamiliar with pay-to-win I would just like to walk through it's dangers real quick. First off, pay-to-win is when ""donators"" pay to receive some non-aesthetic in game item or perk. If this is not done then I call the game play-to-win meaning all perks or items are achieved though actually playing the game as intended. Pay-to-win servers are not very fun to play unless you are very affluent. For the average player, you have to progress through the game slowly in a limited way unless you can afford to buy things with real life currency. If you can't, someone may have an item you will never get to have, live in a place you can't live, or simply be able to enjoy some kind of event you are left out of. This is never fun. Worst of all pay-to-win servers are not just poisonous to themselves, but also other servers. When servers start to compete for players as they will eventually do once eco really takes off. The best thing they can do is simply find ways to make their server more fun to play. However, their is also the issue of machine costs to run the server. Better internet, better performance, and if eco's updates cause it, they will need more space for a larger and more complex game that requires even more server resources. In addition to that, to compete with other servers they need to advertise. I have seen online advertisments for game servers go well over one thousand US dollars. It is ridiculous. (also, depending on how modding goes and such, servers could end up having to pay modders to create unique mods for their servers.) Whether it is for machine costs or for some sort of advertisement, these things need lots of money. If pay-to-win servers are allowed, they will bleed out any other servers that don't get as many donations whom are play-to-win. I would also like to remind everyone that nobody that thinks up a possible pay-to-win feature is evil, they are just trying to expand their server so that more people can enjoy it. It is good intentions with a large, often unforeseen cost. One last note, you should also consider the issue of ""vote-to-win"". Receiving anything for voting for a server on a forum or on a special voting site should be considered a trade between something outside the game for something inside the game and therefore a payment. This should violate the EULA as well. Thank you for reading if you made it this far into my post. Have a good day and may ""donations"" always be donations."

ideas-feedback,ECO EULA | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2264/eco-eula,1879,5,4,rentechd,"Its a very nice thought that putting in a EULA rules about what kind of mod could be done for a moddable game and what could not would be doable but unfortunately, even if it was enforceable doing so would be quite the nightmare When you come to game mods, what can be modded can be controlled somewhat through the code of the game but only to an extent.  As for what those mods can do, again that can be control to an extent by how the game is coded but cannot be control completely or completely blocked. Your suggesting that a EULA dictate whether mods can be made where benefits can be given to donators or pay to win opotions added and so on.  You do not need a mod in the game for gifts to be given to donators - all you need is a server admin in the game.  The sort of control you are talking about is best done by the server operators themselves, but if an owner wants a mod that gives benefits to certain players and not others that is up to them and not the game maker.  If the mod that an owner chooses ruins the game for you then you need to fix that by finding a server to play on that does not have a mod, not dictate what all servers should be allowed to do. Even if a game developer thought to micro-control the type of mod that could go on their game doing so through the EULA  would prove to not be the way  to do it.  Game companies have tried to control content of mods through making the mod content owned by them  once it was publically released to be used by the game.  Think what happened with The Sims and public nudity proved that control did not work. I think the kind of control you want is just not, actually, even the place of the developer if they create a game that is moddable.  What might 'break' a game for you as a mod might make the game exciting and new to someone else.  And its really crazy to put something in the EULA that you aren't even or can't even enforce.  I think you will be hard put to find devs that want to spend their time reviewing every mod that comes out, contacting a modder if they don't 'like' a  mod and even trying to get the modder to remove the mod would be impossible. And if you don't like pay-to-win scenerios, then don't play on those servers.  You use Minecraft as an example and allude to Microsoft having issue with or trouble with controlling the pay to play servers.  They don't acre actually.  If people pay and support those pay to win servers then that is up to those people.  They would quickly go away if no one paid to play and win.  The reason they don't is because there are a section of the Minecraft playing population that enjoys them.  I don't see the fun in it but who am I to say its wrong that they spend tehir money that way?   And actually I don't need a mod to play Eco as a pay to win game right now.  If you like I can create a server where, if you pay me certain amounts, I will just give yu what you want from the game. You may not like certain mod ideas or even certain ways a game/world is run on a server but that is real the option of the server owner when you make a game with configurable options.  Then to try and control what can be selected as a option via the EULA is not the way to go.    And I don't know that such control would be a good thing.  One thing that has kept minecraft in the gaming public eye for so long is that it could be modded to be anything for anybody and  neither mojang or microsoft ever tried to say that you could not have this or could not do that or tried to dictate their belief system through control of mods.  They let that come about by how well received a server was with group of mods on it or not.  What maybe a mod that you think is terribly wrong and hurts the game might be a mod that is loved and very popular to a large portion of the paying population.  Its not really anyone's choice to dictate what mod can be made for people to try/use or not.  There are some pretty awful mods out there for games I play like Minecraft, ARK,   7DTD,  City Skylines,  Conan, (I could go in) - in my opinion but those same mods are very popular.  There are others that I think are cool and handy that others don't like.  I don't run to the devs asking them to pull the ones I don't like because they are not going to even if they don't like them because they are wise enough to know that 'modding' is all about changing the game to the ways/options you like - and that's not something that can be dictated to others. I think your premise that a game developer try and control modding via the EULA is a pretty constraining one.  If a developer is going to be in agreement with their game being ""changed"" via modding then they will need to accept that some of those changes will be things that they would 1) not do and/or 2) things they don't agree with. Most developers even see modding as a way to satisfy people who have given feedback saying the game ""should do this"" or ""not do that"" or ""have this thing"" or ""not have that thing"".  Adding modding allows the player to do or have those things/game aspects that the game developer decided were not something they wanted in the core game but recognized some players might have a better experience if they could have that in the game.  That's why you often see statements like:  '....that is not something in game but could be added via a mod..."" as a totally viable dev response in many. many games."
ideas-feedback,ECO EULA | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2264/eco-eula,1879,5,5,mickhatesgames,"Edited, please  re-read. Thank you and sorry for the inconvenience Thank you for taking the time in writing your reply. I am a bit confused however, I don't believe I said anything about restricting mods. If I did, it was a failure to word my point correctly. If you are implying that my EULA idea would require the devs to limit mods in some way, I would have to disagree. Someone could make a plugin that encourages vote-to-win, I don't care. The EULA would still restrict servers from being able to use it. (Through reports and threats of a forced shutdown, and general community avoidance since the EULA would mean that the server is at risk of shutdown anyways and it would be best for the player to find a new server. I would like to think I covered most the points on the how the EULA could be enforced, but if you would like me to elaborate more on a certain aspect I can.) Maybe you are implying that since mods can be created to give players perks, that would be violating a EULA but that is not how I would want the EULA to be structured. The EULA should stop any and all perks from being achieved through a trade between something outside the server, for something inside the server. This would be anything native to the game or added in by a mod. Common things being traded being real money or a vote. I believe that all things in the game or added through mods, should be achievable only through work inside the game itself.  Someone can make a mod that allows people to fly, that is fine by me. This perk can be given to a player for an in-game currency or through an achievement of sorts or just by default. What would cause harm to the server and all other servers is when a player can get this perk through something like a donation or through voting. I see your point about how the decision should be up to the server owner and not the game makers, however I do not agree. I am all for freedom to server owners getting to re-shape the game. I want to restrict this one aspect not because I care how they run their server, but because it affects all the other servers. This goes right along with you telling me to just find another server that isn't pay to win. One day I won't be able to do that. Through all the costs of custom mods, advertisements, and server upkeep. (which can add up to pretty crazy amounts of money if this game ever gets huge) Only servers that have donators will be able to foot that bill. People naturally like to 'spend' more money than they 'donate'. First, if they are willing to donate 20$ to help keep the server alive, but the server owner will give them this amazing perk for 40$, well they are going to pay it most of the time. They feel good about the spend like it was selfless, and they get a cool perk. Secondly, that server that is not pay-to-win is receiving fewer donations not just because people like to spend rather than donate but because more and more players will come from pay-to-win servers and be turned off by not receiving some kind of perk by donating. Third, as the costs of running a server rise, the harder it will be for the non-pay-to-win servers to survive. People will stop donating simply because they do not expect the server to be around much longer. They see other servers scraping in hundreds of dollars while this server only managed to raise 50$. Why give to a server that doesn't give you anything back and you expect it to die soon. You said that those servers in minecraft that are pay to win thrive because people like them, but that is not true. They simply choked out the competition. I have never heard pay to win being used as a complement for a minecraft server. I have even seen donators themselves reflecting on it saying how it ruined the game for them. They are played because they can out fund the other servers. I don't know any pro-pay to win minecraft players. I have owned servers myself, some that were pay to win. I hated it as the owner. I have played minecraft for years, I watched it happen and I fear the same future for ECO. Without preventive measures, it will be inevitable. It will not be something you can avoid by just going to another server. If you stop pay to win servers, then play to win servers won't have to compete and they will thrive. Bringing a fun, fair game for everyone. Some points I would like to make to avoid confusion. Thanks for the feedback, Shaun ""Mick"" Coyne

Whats more fun,  discovering the culprit by in game methods or just having the SA read a log.   And as it is 'dumping' is not illegal or punishable unless you make it so on your server. What things your might see as a person exploiting game play to make another unhappy (which it could be don't get me wrong) in other ways might be someone just playing out the reality of how they handle refusage and recycling.

I mention this because lately I have been assisting my server admins with building roads, and i go through stacks of corn like nothing as you burn calories so quickly building long wide roads..... I usually eat corn since it gives me decent calories even though i may lose a skill point or two because my SP/Day drops to like 13, but for an hour of work where i have to eat every 5 mins you go through a ton of corn and you really only lose 1 or 2 skill points during that time.... a trail mix that maybe gave 500 calories but could keep you at about 20 SP/day would be very handy for these hard labor periods."

It's a great idea but it seems to be quite early in development. With the zoning aspect shown on the facebook site it will make a huge jump towards being more useful. However I'd like to know where the idea is thought to lead to. Currently we have the possibilities to limit: With this currently (5.5.4) being the full list it's obvious that it isn't complete yet, so this is no complaint :) Playing some hours on different servers I had the chance to see some laws in action and wondered what players come up with to make up for the missing possibilities. A ""craft max 2 Tailings per 1 day"" to save the diminishing Wheat poopulation isn't that useful at all ;) So I think this list of ""Killing"" actually needs every plant and animal in game. Following the thought consequently brings us to the question why it shouldn't be possible to restrict the ""Crafting"" of any item in game? We don't want tailings? Let's also restrict the crafting of Bloomeries. This may lead to a very complex and thus limiting law system with the ability for players fairly advanced in the skill tree to build up a monopoly. I want to sell my Powered Carts? Let's restrict crafting of Wood Carts and Wainwright Tables to zero. If the parliament is on holiday I'll get my monopoly quite easy ;) So we also need countermeasures i.e. to cancel a law. Maybe I didn't just see the right button for that though. What I also discovered was the fact that a law that limits Killing of Common Grass only forbids using the Scythe on a the grass although the plant isn't removed. It just prevents me from getting Plant Fibers which I needed to craft a Research Table. But I could easily use my Shovel to remove the Dirt Block on which the grass was growing on. So this law didn't save the grass but just limited my progress. Is there a possibility to prevent the Dirt Blocks protected plant are gowing on from being dug up? So using a Scythe on a Common Grass plant should be allowed because it actually does no harm. For Wheat which disappears when harvested with the Scythe things look different. This has to be prevented if there is an active law (which currently isn't possible, see above), don't you think? Having mentioned prevention of digging up Dirt, are there plans to prevent/limit mining i.e. ""pickaxing"", ""shoveling"" or even ""placing"" blocks in certain zones? Like a nature reserve.
I could also imagine a law that restricts mining iron ore mayba as an alternative for limited crafting of iron ingots. So players can be ""encouraged"" to invest points in efficiency. One thing that quite annoyed me was a guy who propsed a law that wasn't useful at all (see above). On the first try the law was voted with ""no"" by the
majority and I was quite content. But he stubbornly started a second try with the same parameters and it got voted ""yes"" on the second try. IRL i'd call such
a guy stubborn like a little child: ""But I want that"" (desperately stamping his foot ;) ) IMHO a repeated try of the exact same law proposal by the same
person should be prevented. How do real life law systems handle that case? I don't know. The automtic law breaking prevention is necessary as long as there is no criminal justice system. Will that be a server configuration or will the law breaking prevention completely be taken out of the game? I'd prefer the configuration option ;) So this were just my thoughts and questions on the law system. Maybe we want to discuss it here or you have additional ideas? Cya :)"
ideas-feedback,"Feedback and ideas on fuel, farming and currency | ECO Forum",https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2240/feedback-and-ideas-on-fuel-farming-and-currency,2029,4,1,Freds00n,"Hey there, been playing 5.5 for a bit now, got to love this new patch which introduced a lot of new things! On the bottom of my post i've putted a TL;DR to get the main idea of each topic. Here is my general feedback and mostly ideas on numerous topics: Fuel
There are numerous amounts of fuel (power source) available in-game, each having it's own # of power supply.
Now the thing is; which fuel can i use for which machine? Currently i had a struggle getting the pumpjack to work because i simply did not know which kind of generator i needed to make / use. I even tried the waterwheel which didn't work, but then again... why not? There also seems to be a mechanical energy source and regular energy source which could cause confusion and even then you're still not sure which fuel you can actually use (cart, pumpjack?). It would be great to see which machines accept which kind of fuel. A furnance can only be powered with, for example, charcoal. A powered car can only be fueled with gasoline,... and we also need to know which kind of fuel a certain building / car can use. Hopping from building to cart with any kind of fuel and failing to figure out which fuel actually works is a bit of a burden. Some more transparancy would help out a lot. On the power source idea; this would be great for an additional source of income. If someone specs into charcoal (since coal is harder to find) and certain buildings only run on charcoal, you can sell charcoal to those who need it to fuel a certain building. Keeps a couple of power sources alive and can create more demand, instead of 'wasted' points. Farming
It's great we can finally use the farming skill and it works out great, but i'm having certain issues with the current approach.
As in an other thread being discussed; crop rotation would be a cool thing (not going further into this now). First things first; the nutrients are a nice challenge which i've been busy with for quite a while. Firstly because of the reduced SP/day and need of efficiency skills (which is a good thing!!!). Secondly and mostly because i just don't understand the whole idea. I've been googling it to get an idea on this topic (wiki,...) and i've started to understand it but in-game i'm still clueless. Example: Beets. Nitrogen: 8
Phosphorus: 8
Potasium: 12
Moisture: 8 Those are the nutrients that a beet needs and increased with the # of beets grown in the vicinity (or crops in general). Now i was thinking certain crops need more of a certain nutrient (wheat requires 8, 4, 4, 6), in this case beets need loads of potasium since it utilizes this resource more then others but here i was wrong, in fact the growth and yield even went down. This could be my missunderstanding of the whole fertilizer idea but i'm still confused on how this topic works while i do like the process of trying things out, but it's such a hassle. For now the best thing i've found is balance all the nutrients. Eco would be a GREAT step to learn IRL situations imo (like farming, smelting ores, woodcutting, taking care of the environment,... -> i looked up nutrients for plants and learned something about this topic!) and i was thinking of making a manual, so not just a 'skill' to learn but an actual book / tutorial which guides you into a certain skill, which could link to IRL jobs or situations (learn about nutrients for plants, learn how smelting ores work,...). Ofcourse this is a bigger idea, but in general a manual / book, which you can put in the bookshelf. This book can be crafted with papers and a printer (high-end industry?); the thing is... you still need to figure out how it works but you do have a manual later on, once you've acquired the skill to make a printer. This could explain more complex skills (like farming and nutrients, pollution,...). Which brings me to the next idea; you can also craft an empty book and write the story yourself and write down data for you and possibly the next generation farmers coming after you on the server... Some kind of legacy. This would be very cool and is possible for numerous occasions. Or both ideas, haha. :) Currency
ATM i love the currency aspect, which adds a new dimension to trading but then again it could be improved even more. Firstly i'll start with the argument i've made before; i would love to have an even more dynamic skill system where players have a job instead of skills (sort of lock in a certain skill). This system can be modified in numerous ways; make skill scrolls more expensive, reduce SP income / skill SP amount needed (as we notice in current alpha),... Currently the main idea i get is; max SP / day is about 180. Previous alpha it was way higher and end-game was achieved even faster, this is a good step in the right direction; efficiency skills are finally usefull and you actually NEED to spec into 'em to be usefull in a certain skill or else you're pretty much stuck gathering 24/7. Imo it's still not enough and also with regard to currency / creating an economy i'm still struggling. On my current server everyone is again specing all over the place, which doesn't create demand when everyone has all skills and produces everything on their own. The incentive is needed by the players, not by the system, which i'd love to see by adding jobs instead of skills. If someone is a baker / cook, you will need to buy food from him because you can craft simple food types (the first skill you'll unlock; survival, campfire cooking) but to achieve better SP you'll need that person. Now the main issue is still the same; the cook is the most important person on the server if you want to acquire a better SP/day, but with the current SP / day you'll gain about 146 SP / day with pretty much 'starter' food, and 180~ SP / day is already the MAX amount. That being said; if you can acquire about 100ish SP/day with regular cooking you're pretty much set, 180SP is just (way) better and that requires you to buy food from the cook; the cook will need better fuel sources from someone else, resources to make a kitchen, stove, or even a building in general. It's a vicious circle for any job; you'll always need someone. This creates a huge amount of demand since everyone needs someone else. Now the biggest con; you will need a certain amount of players to get this system rolling (to fill in all the jobs); this could be solved by adding an admin command to allow multiple jobs for (probably) the admin or a certain player to spec in multiple skills to support a beginning civilization. Perhaps the government can control the jobs and allow certain players to spec in certain skills (especially with pollution buildings and cooking -> extinction of plants / animals). The current climate is great since specing into efficiency is pretty much mandatory, but everyone can do this and once the skill scrolls start to roll out everyone is pretty much a master in every skill, sitting on their own private island. Everyone also asks for all the scrolls (which isn't a bad thing) but undermines a currency system because there is no demand, except for high-end products, until that's being researched / learned. There's also some side ideas: Let the government create jobs to spread their currency way better then other currencies. The main problem: you need to craft it yourself or sell goods in a certain shop somewhere in the world. You get it; incentive is player-based again, not system based. You need to gather gold, create bars, go to the mint, create currency (spec into smithing, gold smelting,... Everyone has and needs the skill) or you need to gather / craft good X and go to shop Y and sell it there for currency (main problem again; everyone does everything, no demand :/). There's a lot of barriers created to get a currency going. Let the government get players going by building a building (shopping area, town hall,...) which pays them X amount of currency by participating in the project. (need food, need building mats, need builders,...) Could be combined with the above idea of the 'jobs instead of skills' idea.  Everyone could receive an income by the government (to spread currency) and receive extra coins with their own business. The next idea is to allow the mint to spread a 'loan' to allow players to click one button and they get coins from the government / currency makers which they will need to pay back. A sort of document could be made which both players can accept, gives them the coins and X amount of time to pay it back. You don't need certain goods, just be trustworthy and the government can start spreading currency straight away. Perhaps the mint can create the document. Last idea here is to allow to print paper money, which requires the use of papers. Gold ore can eventually run out while trees can be replanted, which allows the currency maker to keep on spreading the currency. Late-game again; requires paper + printer (like the book example - late-game industry item) and lets you create currency with papers / wood. Those are the main ideas i've been thinking about, let me know what you think and don't hesitate to discuss! TL;DR: Fuel
Too many fuel sources; no clue what to use them for. More transparency which building / cart uses which fuel sources.
Limit fuel sources certain buildings can use; not only late-game fuel source, more demand for certain fuel sources (instead of 'wasting' Sp early on in charcoal for example -> blast furnance can 'only' use coal and charcoal, baking oven can only use wood / coal,...), which sort of is the case already, but without transparency. Farming
Nutrients too complex, such a hassle to figure it out (lowered SP/day -> is a good thing!, but need many goods and efficiency in other skills to start research, even then i'm still rather clueless).
Make manual books which are written as a tutorial or player written, which players figured out on their own and wrote down for themselves / others to read -> will keep things in-game instead of having to look for a tutorial outside of the game (removes barrier of opening internet, googling forums,...). Books; late-game item. Requires paper and printer (end-game industry + electricity?). Can be stored in a bookshelf for later use (player written; your own legacy!). Still need to figure it out in the beginning; late-game will have a book that explains it for you. Allows more complex skills and will learn you about IRL situations (plant nutrients? How is it made?). :) Currency Currently too many barriers for someone to obtain currency / spread currency. Need efficiency in gold smelting, need to go to mint, need too many player incentives instead of system incentives. Everyone is all over the place with regard to skills; nobody needs certain items (especially not late-game if not created by the players, forced creation, RP) because there is no demand. Allow jobs instead of skills; government can control jobs: someone is a cook, someone is a road paver / stone worker, blacksmith,... Government / currency maker can pay jobs an income to spread currency. Allow government to spread building projects (needs food for workers for increased calorie consumption, needs building mats for project,...) -> probably the building plot flag? Allow government / currency maker to create a loan. Both players need to 'sign' a contract (with gold ore and paper for example) which gives players X amount of currency to get them started; allows you to spread currency easier and faster. Contract gives player X amount of time to pay it back / is being filled in by revenue generated by player's shop, job, government project,... Allow the creation of 'paper' money; less gold bars / ore (or even none) + paper and a printer (same as for the books, late-game industry building). Print your own money, doesn't require as much gold ore (you need to find it, limited resource, paper isn't -> trees can be replanted, gold can't, currency maker will run into trouble sooner or later). There you go, Cheers! Freds00n"

Jobs vs skills is an interesting one, since you have to strike a balance of not preventing players from progressing too harshly. I think there's still lots of room for improvement here, will take your ideas into consideration. Fuel needs more feedback yes, good opportunity for collaboration as you mention, a consumable like food but for machines. Loans I love, as well as govt incentivized labor (tax breaks?).  We will definitely do that at some point."

Love the currency and job system idea. Right now everyone can do everything really fast and there is no need to trade or use contracts.  The infinite scroll from books, Food that never spoils, unbreakable tools, no decay system and other little things kills the purpose of the economy and contracts.
Tech has no value since you can just research, right click and generate infinite pages.....
Each book should generate only 2 pages max, if you want more, you need to craft a new book.
So, the tech will be something with value because it will not be infinite and easy.
The amount of daily skill is really huge, even with basic foods. These things should be optional, so we could have servers with settings like hard mode, easy mode, economy-based, zero economy(everyone can do everything), job system, limited skill cap, books with endless pages, books with limited pages.... With everything optional and defined on server settings, there will be no reason to complain because it will be possible to create servers for every player styles."
ideas-feedback,"SUGGESTION:  Hydroelectric Powers, Dams, Flow Gates | ECO Forum",https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2251/suggestion-hydroelectric-powers-dams-flow-gates,1128,2,1,Ravenal,"I would LOVE to have hydroelectric powers.  That was one of the fun thing about ""Dig or Die"" game with their water physics and making a dam.  If you added this, with the water physics you guys plan to do.  This would be so awesome.   This could really change how the ecosystem works.  It could affect river flows, adjust soil content due to the river flow reduced.  It could allow you to create man-made reservoirs  etc.   It would be also great to add Switch Gates, runoffs etc.  All controlling the river flow etc.   You could even build early wood dams.  Make the hydroelectric dams generators produce power based on the power of the river current etc.  Of course this would probably be pretty high on the CPU of the server if someone would to create a dam then destroy it, causing it to flood.  But again you could do water physic prediction as that is possible since you can have 'look advance' concept.  Whereas based on the amount of volume the water is at, you can then determine based on the river bed, determine the speed, flow, and based on that you can use 'particles'/'effects that simulate tidal waves, then have it adjust the water height as it moves.  The particle effects would be an illusion to the constant changes which would just simply change.  Players would see the effect more so than the actual water changes.  They'll be like OH shit!  Get out of the way haha....  You can then tell where the water flow would end up being over time.  Have it destroy anything in it's path.  Of course remember...   What you do can affect the ecosystem others around you.  World Generators could make it so that river zoning is automatically added to prevent players from adding things to the river that can adjust the flow of the rivers etc.   as I could see trolls go in build a dam and destroy it causing others to loose their crops/trees because of it.   I am sure you guys can come up with a logical solution to make it so that it can be FUN and enjoyable without having trolls be jerks."

in the game context i would set it so to keep the balance every other planting should be this bulk seed.
so wheat- bulk - wheat. as at the moment you can get 3-4 rotations before failure, then wait a short time and your good to go again. i would have 2+ bulks, so one will add only 2 nutrients. so you had to plan your farm fields carefully."

ideas-feedback,Crop Rotation vs fertilizers | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1966/crop-rotation-vs-fertilizers,2725,4,4,midn8t,well how it works right now is it just regenerates over time. so you just leave field plowed and in half hour or so everything is back to normal. we did experiment with tiling also land seems regenerate really fast. best way to farm right now is to do field rotation not corp so u leave field barren and use a diff field and just rotate between them.

As for fitting it into the game right now, maybe adding flowers which can be farmed, and have some sort of processing of these through agriculture?

His came back tho after the world got to load a little around him. Ive had one cart disappearing and reappearing. two lost completely and not coming back no matter how i load the chunks around me. They stubbornly stay out of bounds.
My carts has prop something to do with the border, they both vanished completely around 20 ""blocks"" away from the border.
But my friends cart vanishing is a different thing. Its too far from the border.
Other players in my world has had their carts going missing when unloading the chunks. And they too are far from the border."

In real life arc furnaces they lower two giant carbon electrodes into a crucible full of iron or steel. This creates an ark between the electrodes which burns at around 2800 degrees fahrenheit, if they tried water cooling this process the metals would not melt thereby making the process of an arc furnace not work. When an arc furnace is smelting metals the process is twice as efficient as a blast furnace and produces little slag, one run of a blast furnace will produce roughly 10,000 pounds of liquid metal and roughly around 500 pounds of slag which is then reprocessed further to get other metals and impurity cleaned up. Back in the 1980's this slag was dumped and was for the most part non-harmful to the environment although there is a chance of some impurities in the slag that is harmful so regulations on slag dumping was put in place. As far as water cooling it never happens to the furnace of a smeltry it happens in the forming area of the factory to remove scaling from the metal being formed. In fact water would be a bad thing for an arc furnace when you have thousands of watts and volts of electricity flowing at all times. As far as in game the blast furnace produces more slag then an arc furnace. Having slag in game would not be a bad thing as the devs could make an item that can further refine the slag to get gold and copper in small amounts. I would suggest before trolling ideas in the ideas and feedback forums that you do your research before posting."

Most low-tier food recipes has a small caloric gain, eg charred camas bulb being worth 300 calories while the 4 camas bulbs required provide 240 calories if eaten raw. 1 unit of flatbread takes a base 10 units of flour.
1 unit of flour takes a base of 20 wheat.

That is 10x20x75=15000 Calories if the 200 wheat required for 1 flatbread is eaten raw instead of the 500 Calories for the flatbread itself.
The 5 fat gained from making flatbread hardly makes up for the 14500 calories lost. One way to balance it would be to say 1 flatbread = 2 flour = 2x3 wheat.

ideas-feedback,Skill point gain idea | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1434/skill-point-gain-idea,7274,17,4,Gates,"I was considering a post like this myself and I like where you are going but not the idea of flat skill gain.  I love the ability for the game to track rooms and want to see that further developed to the point you can detect all the rooms connected to a house say 1 workshop 1 bedroom 1 bathroom.  Each room would be of diffrent qualities depending on say bathroom has running water, bedroom has bed, workshop has lighting. The reason I want this is I feel this game needs an exponentially increasing cost of more advanced technology.  This would mean that you would need an exponentially increasing skill gain to keep up with costs as right now skill gain increase is a bit linear.  This means that playershe would need additional multipliers to keep up.  Good food for a strong base skill gain, balanced diet gives x2 gain, good shelter from elements via bedroom in house up to 2x, proper health and sanitation from bathroom 2x, education from public facilities 2x. The reason for this is I feel skill gain is a linchpin to the games economy but it's far to dependent on cooks.  Spread out skill gain so people with other skill sets can contribute to the overall skill gain.  It will also put additional strain on the ECO to gather these things forcing more cooperation by say outlawing that bed that gives an extra 1.1x skill boost for bedrooms but costs a 100 wolf pelts to make."

And I agree again we need to diversify from food though I wouldn't invest much time into a perfect balance it's always been a bit of a red Haring as its so hard to get perfect.  Besides I believe people will go to extreme lengths to milk every point they can out of skill buffs anyway so even vague skill trees that offer a 1.01 x buff will get used eventually. One thing I want to see along that thought is intentionally super expensive buffs.  I want to see people tempted to get one more perk at an extreme cost to the ecosystem like a food delicacy that is wasteful, costs 100s of plants and gives massive buff to whoever goes for it.  It will tempt players to take more than they need for personal gain at the cost of the common resource as now there are a 100 ok meals that could of been made to feed the whole server without driving buffalo extinct"

That value could be used to determine the level of political power you can obtain. Example:

Lvl1 Civilized person.

I propose a school that allows you to refund some skill points to re-train in to a new profession. say you where a cook and would now like to be a smelter. Like in a real world situation you would know loose all of your previous training but you would no longer be an expert. for example, if you have level 5 in culinary arts and you re-train, you go back to level 2 and receive the skill points that were used to level from level 2 to level 5. Another benefit of a school is, for people that have not had the best diets and not received many skills points through out their time, they can train some up in their selected profession. For example, at the school table (we will call it, i envision something like the town hall but with more books/shelves) you can skill up masonry but creating stone products at the school table (items crafted at the Quarry), they are consumed by the table and grant you a skill/s based on the materials used and products crafted. Schooling could be a branch of the civics tree and allow people that have maxed out a profession to create and train others for a fee (perfect with the currency system). This would be the limitation so that people that already have received a lot of skill points will not be able to take advantage and gain an exponential amount of skill points. So in short, only those that have level 5 in a specific skill can make a school and allow others to train at, whether for a fee or for free"

Since 5.5 released the tooltips, at least for me, have been more then enough help in locating things.  Maybe there is a balance there but I think too much of a ""go there, do this"" in the tooltip would take away from the ""figure stuff out"" aspect of the game.

So with that formula almost everyone is going to be a laborer.  There are more low SP cost skills in the survival tree.  It is worth the SP to jack of all trade into that skill. To work around this my suggestion is that we use the amount of skill points spent in a tree to determine your job title on the minimap.  I will use my current numbers as an example.  Right now I am considered a politician with 12 levels in the skill tree with the current system, but with my proposed plan I should actually be a mason.  At the moment I only have 9 levels in the masonry skill tree.  But I have more SP in masonry.  Masonry SP = 63, Civic SP = 52.

ideas-feedback,City planning. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1537/city-planning,2119,7,1,ReignDance,"Whenever I play, it seems like some people don't fully understand the concept of this game; which is to work together with everybody. Instead, it seems that there becomes small groups of players here and there and some loners. Buildings that get built seem to be spaced out over large areas. It really doesn't feel like a village. It just feels like a landscape with structures placed haphazardly. I suggest having some sort of ""city planner""; a way to zone if you will. The city planner will zone for residential and industry/commerce. Some way to make this game orderly instead of chaotic."

I don't mind all that running back and forth. It's part of the fun. I love games where you start out in the woods, and stone by stone, brick by brick, tree by tree, you slowly build up a city. I have loved this idea for years and I still play these kinds of games. But ECO is the only one that has this ability, AND keeps the environment in check. I love that ! So please, make it an option for single player vs multiplayer. I most of the time will play as a loner and everyonce in a while I might play with others, but rarely."

ideas-feedback,5.5.1 feedback on material costs. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2026/5-5-1-feedback-on-material-costs,1513,7,1,Flix79,"I find that some of the material costs is way out of proportion and not realistic. Foods:
all chared foods take 3 or 5 raw to make the cooked (your telling me that if I take an ear of corn and stick it on the campfire It'll take 3 ears to get one ear of corn back?) lumber takes 10 logs? Boards take 5 logs? (Back to real life, one log will generally yield around 10 boards and as far as lumber which is basically an 8x8 board you can get at least one per log.) Ingots of all types. (I would say this is closer to real life but I think 2 ore would be more appropriate of a proportion.) And butchery is way screwed up. (I have butchered elk and other animals in my life, and to say that prepared meat AKA a steak does not take a whole elk to make. lets be serious here as the elk gives 10 raw meat when butchered and you can only get 1 prepared meat out of it. And raw sausage taking 20 scrap meat? I can make enough sausage to from 20 scraps of meat off a single elk to make 10 to 20 sausages.) Sorry if this seems like a rant but it feels like this went from a simulation to a goal of destroying the ecology of the planet. If this is still a sim then it should follow some realistic norms."

ideas-feedback,5.5.1 feedback on material costs. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2026/5-5-1-feedback-on-material-costs,1513,7,3,Joshiki,"I agree with what Flix79 has stated.  I understand the need of the efficiency skills but the start up is still way too high. Your efficieny points don't count for enough in the beginning.  For the amount of materials you are requiring the 3rd level efficiency  should cost fewer points and gain a higher %.
Ideally there would be several people in each professional skill to be able to concentrate on just that one skill but realistically that's not the case.  Most of the servers are VERY LUCKY to have 6 steady players and even then only 2 to 4 on at any given time.
What would be ideal is to make available an ability to set the game as say EASY/Moderate/Hard or set to amount of people playing.
Easy=3 to 6 players
Moderate=7 to 11 players
Hard=12 and up
Set the amount of materials required to the amount of people playing.
Or Another suggestion...a slider for materials required say 25/50/75/100.   Let people choose how hard they want the game to be...that way as a teaching tool used in large classrooms your setup would work as intended.  For the rest of us we could actually enjoy the game the way it best suits us to play.

ideas-feedback,5.5.1 feedback on material costs. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2026/5-5-1-feedback-on-material-costs,1513,7,6,toxxikz,"I can understand a high cost at first, you give a guy a log for the first time ever and tell him you need a perfect 2x4 out of it, it may take him a few logs to get there honestly.  But the costs should have a better efficiency rating, I mean more realistic would be yes a beginner may take  a few logs to get a perfect board but as he becomes more proficient (which is what efficiency is supposed to be simulating) that same person would end up getting multiple boards out of one log.  So yeah I can see 5 logs to get a board at first, but once maxed out when your proficient then you should maybe get between 3-5 boards from one log. Same can be said for butchering a deer, my first deer my uncle talked me through it but made me cut it up myself....so much meat was wasted, but now a days no meat gets wasted, over the years I became better and better and I probably get 3 times the meat out of a deer compared to my first one. You want realist simulation then high costs at first sure, but the max efficiency then needs to be better than 80% it should maybe be 150%. I understand the lower skill points to get new skills or improve those skills, but at the same time you severely dropped the number of skill/day that you get from the food as well and that in a way didn't make the ratio much better, cheaper skill point costs but higher materials, but the skill points for day  dropping so much it really doesn't allow for the lower skill requirements to truly effect the game much differently.  Honestly the only real change in progression that I have seen is I spend more time away from the game than i did before because in order to get the higher cost of materials I am using way more calories way quicker and i just cant cook enough food fast enough to keep up, not to mention the farming needs some work.  I play on a very populated server of 21 active people and farming is a must, but even with perfect temp and moisture my crop growth rate is like 40% because of the nutrients, but the nutrients aren't easy to figure out, you need a masters in mathematics and science to get anywhere near 80% growth rate, do you really think kids in school learning from this game are going to want to spend the hours it will take to research the nutrients and then calculate exactly what fertilizers you need to even get close to an 80% growth rate. So in retrospect i find myself playing less because the high costs of materials has me burning through calories too quickly and with less skill points from the food I am not leveling my efficiency in a time efficient manner so I am having to wait 12 hours for my crops to grow so I can make food to play for 10 minutes and be out of food and calories again and then wait another 12 hours to play again..... I didn't think this game was meant to be played 20 minutes a day, it has way too much potential to actually keep me entertained for hours at a  time but i think the time efficiency of the game went down between 5.4 and 5.5.  It has become wait for crops to grow log in spend the skill points harvest the food cook it, gather as many materials as I can before getting too low on calories and then log out to wait 12 hours for the crops to grow, rinse repeat."
ideas-feedback,5.5.1 feedback on material costs. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2026/5-5-1-feedback-on-material-costs,1513,7,7,Askardius,"I realy like the idea of very high starting costs, and low skillpoint costs for the basic talents. The main problem actually, as i see it, is that efficiency is not effiecient.
I was going for cooking and food in general with 5.5, cause i made it in 5.4 without farming and i wanted to see the difference. The idea was, that i provide a bunch of people with good food and the can specialice on something else. Well with the actual skills we have the problem, even with efficiency i barely get my own food consumption done. So there is no food to provide to others. All the others have the same problem, so actualy everyone is specialising on food and farming, cause you need food to get stuf done. That means, for exampel, on a server with 90 people we actually have 1 (yes ONE) who is specialised in smelting and in the other skilltrees it doesnt look better.
So the starting point is fine but efficiency has to be much much more efficient, at the moment with all the specialisation you get near the starting point of 5.4 and that cant be the way to go, otherways i will never feed a bunch of other people and in the end we are all a big bunch of farmers and cooks."

ideas-feedback,5.5 feedback. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2012/5-5-feedback,444,1,1,Dramier,"We've been playing on our 5.5 server for a few hours now and we (my girlfriend and I) would like to give you our feedback: Migration from 5.4 to 5.5:   This was super easy and worked flawlessly the first time.   I would say that there needs to be a good write-up that is clear on exactly how it is done.   I say this because I was able to figure it out quickly because I'm fairly intelligent and have a ton of experience with dedicated servers.   Finding the correct migration tool and such was a little complicated, so it might be nice to have the tool linked on the server files page, although from what I understand this tool should not be necessary going forward. User interface:   We absolutely love the new changes to the interface with the color coordination, the click on links to take you straight to the research tree, etc.   Every single detail so far has been wonderful and made playing the game so much more seamless and enjoyable.   Well done!   In particular the addition of the hotkeys was a much needed improvement and we are looking forward to more keybinding in the future. Carts:   So far we have had none of the previous issues with carts.   They have worked much more fluidly and we have not had the issues with not being able to use them or having them get stuck.   One thing we would like to bring up is that deeds and deed control is still an issue.   For example we have a cart that we can't find the deed to and cannot pickup.   I'm sure we have the deed we simply can't find it among the various dozens of containers.   If the future includes more deeds for various items, it might become a more serious problem. Animals:   We have noticed no particular changes here although it does seem like populations are fluctuating more, but could just be our imagination. Plants:  Our world initially only had 5 bean plants total when we started it in 5.4.   Now with 5.5 it seems to have sprouted more bean plants and we've also noted more species in the wild.   Perhaps again not anything changed on your end, but worth noting. Calories/skill gain:  Since there are only two of us, we play with a multiplier of 50.   We definitely noticed the huge change in how much food now changes your balance and it seems to be more responsive and easier to manage.   We love the skill per day being added to the bar as it makes it much easier to see and keep track of.   The added calorie reduction branch in the skill tree is truly a gift from the gods.   Well done. Weight / carrying capacity:  Right off the bat we implemented points into the strong back section and both of us have noted that it seems to be a bit out of balance at the moment.   Previously in 5.4 I would bring back perhaps a 100 huckleberries and a 100 wheat at time.   This seemed pretty fair and encourage exploration.   Now I am bringing back over a 1000 of a crop and it definitely feels unrealistic to be hauling back 1000 corn, 500 wheat, and a bison carcass.   With how the rest of the game feels, we both think this doesn't seem to fit.   Sure it is nice to have that kind of capacity, but we feel like it encroaches on the cart mechanic quite a bit and might need some pruning. Weight / carrying capacity part 2:  We noticed a lag inducing problem with logging.   My girlfriend was cutting down trees and splitting the logs into smaller pieces.   Each time she struck the log it would cause a lag spike, something not previously seen in 5.4.    The game did not crash and no error reports were being created, but there was definitely lag being generated.   Memory usage on the server was still consistent at just over 549 MB and it was using only about 20% of the CPU, which is normal for our setup.   (Dedicated server is an AMD eight core 3.4ghz machine with 8GB RAM running Windows 10.)    Do not know what the cause of this lag was and have not seen it duplicated with any other mechanic yet. Big shovel:   This was a huge improvement.   Being able to pull 10 items from a chest is absolutely what the normal shovel needs to be doing by default.   Please consider making this a permanent change to the regular shovel! So far we have not noted any new bugs other than ones already stated such as the stairs, etc.   Other than the lag with the logging mentioned above, everything seems to be running quite smoothly.   We have noticed it does seem a little more difficult to jump up inclines, but neither of us could determine if it was really a problem or just us getting used to the game again.   FPS is great, we are both playing on 1080P and easily getting above our 60 FPS V-Sync limits.   I can include computer specs if it would be of use to you on both the two client PC's and the server PC. So far so good, and 5.5 has made us very happy!   Looking forward to seeing how the game evolves! Rory & Christine"

IE: a ketogenic diet, 60% protein, 15+%fat/vitamins, >10% carbs would give you a boost in work done and hinder some skill points paleo diet that is vitamin based and gives you a bonus for only having 1 meat/protein based meal in your stomach.  Maybe boost in hunting and gathering? or a carb based diet to give a boost in normal skill point production, the idea being carbs are the fuel of the body and brain.  This also goes into having trouble doing work for long periods of time, see american diet for details. Then of course vegan / vegetarian diet gives you some sort of green thumb for agriculture?  Just throwing ideas out and I welcome any other ideas or critiques.  However if this is an educational game then why not embrace the idea of different dieting methods and use real world scenarios to make the point stick."

As a supporter and lover of your game I have come across a conundrum of decent proportions.While building in eco I found it very hard to get the roof of my building to a spot that I liked it. I tried many blocks and I found it very hard to place them in a certain direction. It took me hours to find out what I needed to do to get the blocks to fit nicely. I felt frustrated when blocks faced in the complete opposite direction I wanted them to. Luckily I have thought of an easy way you guys could make it easier on the builders in this game. In eco you are allowed to turn the crafting tables in the direction you want them to face by pressing E (by default I believe) yet stairs and roofs face the direction that a block is connecting to them. So why not have the stairs and roofs work like the crafting stations? Sincerely,
Fancycat"

There are a lot of awesome ideas here. I'm just going to go down the list and try and mark down my thoughts on each one – it probably won’t get done that fast but I’ll get to each one eventually. This sounds like an awesome idea - like a community bulletin. Not exactly sure what this would be for. It’s possible we could add a tool to check the block distance between two points. It would be easy to implement, but would require a minor amount of art. I’d be curious if enough people would find something like this useful. While there used to be minecarts, we’ve moved towards the roads/woodcarts. There could be a place for something like this in the game, but I wouldn’t want it to replace what we currently have. There are continual improvements going into carts to make them more functional and less buggy, so hopefully stability will be less of an issue in the future (which is one reason why I think people want carts so badly). We have a pretty cool prototype/functional stockpile object that will soon replace the way players store block-type items. This will not make it into 5.5 due to complications regarding crafting, linked inventories, and other supporting features that would be needed to make sure they work correctly. Still, they ARE on the way. As I said above, we have stockpiles plus some ideas about linking inventories inside buildings and in certain areas. I don’t think it will be unlikely for there to be different types and sizes of storage later on."

Because, when you have the log bonus, you tends to try and cut the tree into 1 logs for the increased log bonus outcome and you can't often tell where # amount of log is and you chop off too little, you delete the possible log.

Any thoughts of being able to create greenhouses in the future?  The attributes warmth, moisture, temperature could be partially controlled by the type of material you build the greenhouse from.  For instance, the easiest plant to grow, either fiddleheads or huckleberries could be built from say logs and you would need so many water barrels present to get the correct amount of moisture...that is until a sprinkler system is created let's say...  Wheat and beets maybe out of lumber and camas bulbs from mortared stone.  Maybe corn in brick and beans in concrete and finally fireshoots in steel. One would need to depend heavily on fertilizer to get the correct mix in the soil.  Also have us build planter boxes out of say lumber so the dirt that we add to that box has a zero value of minerals already in it.  We would have to add everything it needed.  So when you dig up dirt and put in a chest or cart or planter box it loses all values it had as far as minerals.  I hope that makes sense lol. I just know from talking to people that many of them want to be farmers and then sell to towns for the other materials they need and right now, (build 5.5 staging), it seems you have to be in a certain location in order to have any sucess with growing one particular crop.  But then that location will not let you grow some of the other crops so one is very limited.  In a true community based atmosphere the farmer should be able to supply the town with all produce needed not just one kind. You could also have the Mayor get access to ""town"" marker flags.  They will set up the spot the town will be and then have specialized buildings that will only go into the ""town marked"" area.  For instance the Co-Op for the farmers, the restaurant for the cooks, stonemason shop, carpenter shop and so on.  One would have to be specialized in the skill in order to reach the level to be able to build their shop in town.  I don't have an idea of how many points that would be but make it so not everyone can do it.  Ok I am done...thanks for listening."

I believe there should be a danger element in the game besides the meteor. Being that the skill points are so important to the game I recommend that when you fall from high distance or in the water too long or even make some of the animals attack you. When this happens you take negative points in skill. This would open the opportunity for a Medical Class. The person putting points in medical could heal you and they could research within their class new ways to improve themselves and other people. They could learn vitamins pills that could temporarily enhance a number of different categories such as increasing the amount you can carry, slow down the rate you lose calories when working, and decrease damage you take just to name a few. Anyway just a thought. it would add a danger element to the game along with a new class to put points into."

My thoughts would be that if you die from a fall or drown or the other 100 ways to die ( I hope ) in game, that you would lose all your current skill point's you have banked up - If they make a hardcore mode for the game I'd be happy to lose whatever is on my player at the time of death or it stay with the body where it died to be picked back up. The Medical skill player is a great Idea and I think a health bar would be the best way to allow them to help heal people so that if they take damage the Medical player can heal them only so far depending on their skill... and it should be the only way that people can be fixed."

What you're saying with losing all of your skill points, or messing with them in any way. This would easily cause people to rage quit from the game for good.
Keep in mind, while you're OK with it. The company who makes this game is a company. There is already people rage quitting from some of the bugs or things like the laser not being in the game but nothing in game says it isn't.
Even if it was stable, this would only work on a hardcore mode like you suggested. I could see it working with if you fall then you get hungry, or something like that. But like I said, skills has to be off limits on this expect if you add it with mods or a hardcore mode.
But even if this was in, I can see people not doing anything or stop playing because they are too afraid of losing all of their points. Keep in mind, this doesn't work during the late game when there is nothing the person wants to put skills in. So the doctor would be useless during late game.

As it stands right now, this can't even really be classified as a survival because you can't die unless the entire world is also destroyed.  It's fun, i'm loving the game so far, but it's definitely one of those things that you try and beat once then never look at it again, and that makes me sad because there is a lot of potential for this game.

-sail boats (PIRATES YAHHRR DORRR VAHRR.)
-makes 200x200 or larger maps less memory eater (my inocence makes me belive my low end hotweels laptop could run a 500x500 world).
-out planet adventures (not as a space game but something like send satelities to space to map the world)
-meke the worldmap only aviliable after discover the satelitie (before this stage the map is just draws in papers ,and only will be revealed after the player discover the area , this will make the players really explore the world ,and not just see the entire map in early game).
-tools with durability, to make sense the ability to forge the firsts tools
-(this was some other guy in the forum whos comment this:) beds, to consume less calories when go off game to gain skill points for more time afk.(better beds affects the quantity of calories lost, like a sleepingrag consume 5% less calories and a master double bed of adamantiun consume85% less, just an exemple, not like will have adamantiun in game or something like this hehe )
-more underwater biomes, with corals, plants in the botton of the ocean, more water life , an boats(I said boats before, so... submarines... underwater exploring).
-some skilltree to catalogue the animals and wild life and plants in the world,(the world can have nothing showed the name of the things and nothing about the animals and the player needs to study every specie to know what is in the world. higher lvs of that skill affects how precise are the datas about the wild life and plants).
-more tipes of woods and variations of logs.(just cosmetic , or... rare woods logs types can be more expensive to buy, so the players needs to see whats is more important , a beauty rare dark oak house in the woods or save the dark oak woods from the extinction).
-birds as real animas, not just as a cosmetic in the world. this is some ideas I have, sorry my bad english."

But as you noted with how hard it is to just do some of these things. This is exactly why they need a NYI on things that don't work or not in the game. Like how hard is it to test if putting down a laser will work or not?

Ya but from my understanding, you couldn't even get lasers before 5.4 (the current version). You should always test the new features. Like they could literally jump into a game, then drop the laser and test to see if it works. If things get bugged out over time, then I think everyone will understand. But some of these problems are just so easy to see if it's bug by jumping in and LOOKING at it. Kinda like how you can't make laws for half of the things unless if the user messes with the website code.
Not to sound all and mighty, but they aren't paying us to test their game. We are paying them. So there could be a minimum of literally looking at and quickly playing with to see if something isn't working. And it wouldn't be too hard to let players know in game so they don't spend their combine efforts of weeks to make something like the laser. Yes this is an EA game, and people should know there is bugs. But a bugged cart is 100% different from something simply not being in the game. Note just putting the item down, and seeing if it does it job only takes minutes. All I'm asking for is this minimum level of looking at something, giving it isn't in the game before. Then real quick putting next to the name NYI.
Since I didn't get the developer version of this, I can't exactly tell you how they are naming things. But normally for something this big you would have the list of names on one given parts like the strings. That away you can have the code call for that string whenever the name needs to show up. This has a major benefit if you ever need to change the name, you're not checking 900 places.
So where someone might think I'm asking for something that would take days. I'm asking for something that would literally take seconds to minutes. So basically, they can see these items weren't in the game. Spawn the items in, put them down if needed, and if it's a table try to make something. Speed up the time, or just say good enough and spawn in the item it would make. Repeat. Oh this thing didn't work, so we will just mark that as not in the game yet so the update will still come out in time. Maybe even see if the bug bounty will help add that in the game. I would think to test an entire new set of items it would take half an hour to an hour at most. Not days or weeks. Keep in mind, I'm still here because I want this game to be successful."

Rooms can be mixed or single-sex, and private rooms may also be available. Hostels are often cheaper for both the operator and occupants; many hostels have long-term residents whom they employ as desk agents or housekeeping staff in exchange for experience or discounted accommodation. In a few countries, such as the UK, Ireland, India and Australia, the word hostel sometimes also refers to establishments providing longer-term accommodation. In India, Pakistan and South Africa, hostel also refers to boarding schools or student dormitories in resident colleges and universities. In other parts of the world, the word hostel mainly refers to properties offering shared accommodation to travellers or backpackers. Within the ""traveller"" category, another distinction can be drawn between hostels that are members of Hostelling International (HI), a UK-based, non-profit organisation encouraging outdoor activities and cultural exchange for the young (formerly the IYHA), and independently operated hostels. Hostels for travellers are sometimes called backpackers' hostels, particularly in Australia and New Zealand (often abbreviated to just ""backpackers"")."

Fuel: 200J/s
Ingots:  1 Ore = 1 Ingot + 2 Tailings / 30 sec
Fuel usage:  6,000J per Ingot produced
1 Ingot = 1.5 Logs if using Logs for Fuel Bloomery
Fuel: 50J/s
Ingots:  1 Ore = 1 Ingot + 2 Tailings / 30 sec
Fuel usage: 1,500J per Ingot
1 Ingot = 0.375 Logs if using Logs for Fuel When working with Ingots, the Blast Furnace is 4x more expensive on fuel with absolutely no benefit.
I recommend that the Blast Furnace should be more efficient than a Bloomery when making Ingots, given that it's a much more advanced piece of equipment.  Once you are able to produce a Blast Furnace, the Bloomery should be replaced because it should be outdated and more inefficient. Some starter suggestions:
Make the Blast Furnace Ingot recipes produce only 1 Tailing per Ingot produced
Make the Blast Furnace have some kind of built-it Tailings reduction
Make the Blast Furnace Ingot recipes have a much faster crafting time, which will improve the Fuel efficiency of that recipe. As it stands right now, you should never use the Blast Furnace for making Ingots, which seems counter intuitive as it should be an upgrade to a Bloomery, which is a very low-tech method of metals production."

My assumption has always been that balancing will come later, maybe even not until beta. But I agree, this is a major balance issue. The blast furnace should make smelting more efficient in the volume of ingots produced, and a decrease in tailings only makes sense. Reducing the craft time makes sense as well, but is by itself not nearly enough to justify smelting in the blast furnace, especially when the blast furnace can be used to constantly make charcoal (something else that is imbalanced and deserves a whole other topic)."

However not all citizens will be working those natural resources, especially in a highly specialized society, yet others might be relying on those resources as their main income. So my suggestion is giving citizens the ability to sell/trade/rent their harvesting allowances, because it creates a win win win situation.
For example let's take a lumberjack on a server with quite strict deforestation laws. With the ability to rent the logging rights from others he'll be able to gather more wood than normal, making it less likely he'll need a second profession or to log illegally to sustain himself. The wood will be gathered by someone with higher yields per log, meaning more wood than prior will hit the market. Yet it doesn't increase the maximum amount of trees chopped for wood, and the lumberjack will be the most invested one in keeping the trees around making him also the most likely to log responsibly(when he isn't squeezed by the laws)."

ideas-feedback,Suggestions for the developers | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1777/suggestions-for-the-developers,927,1,1,Eldeon,"Skills
Let me start by giving you a little story to get my point across. A friend (let’s call him X) and I bought the two-pack alpha package. We started at the same time. The only difference was, I had a week off and he had to work all week. X started learning cooking for the both of us, so he can provide us with the necessary nutrition’s. Now one week later. I build an entire town with facilities for all professions. Friend X did nearly nothing the entire week. X was online for about 30 minutes a day, just to improve his cooking by using the skill points he earned offline and by using the facilities I build to provide us with food.
While I did all the hard work I had to deal with using calories efficiently all day. Because of this my skill point gain is all over the place the entire day. Because X did nothing all day, his skill point gain was stable the entire day. Now at the end of the week X has even more skill points than me. He learned even more professions than me without lifting a finger or even looking at the other professions. I get it you don’t want people with limited play time to feel useless, but this is in my opinion just bad game design. Now let me suggest how it should be in my opinion even for players with limited play time:
Skill point gain should be based on effort and changed into categories. So, for example: Cooking bread will improve the skill gain in the cooking category. While carpentry will earn you skill points in the carpentry category. This way you can specialize in one profession, because you put effort in that profession. You can still reward players with limited time. For example, if you bake like 50 pies while offline you still get the skill points the next time you’ll logon. Players with limited play time can use build orders or contracts to improve their skill while offline. By doing this, the buyer gets the stuff they requested and the chef gets the skilll points. This way you can be a pro chef even with limited playtime. Now for the people who do have too much time on their hands, they have the advantage that they can learn just about everything with a huge amount of effort.  (you can even scale up the skill points the more they learn). Looking at the realistic simulation of the game. Since this is a game learning about the environment you want to encourage people to destroy the environment as much as possible, because it will improve the way they live. That there are friendlier ways is beside the point. The best way to do this, is by gaining skill points by crafting, cutting, sewing stuff. Eating
Eating should affect how well you perform physically in the game. So, with a balanced diet, you can cut faster / better, jump higher, run faster, swim faster, bake more etc. Meteor end game
The end game should be the greed of the players. Earthquakes because of all the drilling, flooding because of global warming, toxic air because of all the smog, unlivable lands because of pollution. Or if you play it right you could live in harmony because of good laws and a lot of extra work by investing in the environment. (using the right energy, clean fuel, planting back tree’s etc.). This in my opinion a better ending than the random meteor server wipe."

Also all wildlife always dies at random, and if not they tele lag/glitch all over the place, gets stuck in objects e.g on roof tiles and so forth, making it impossible to be a hunter. Wood carts gets stuck in the road for no particular reason at all, sometimes they get slung around and defies all rules of physics. The lack of the agricultural and tailoring part is also a mood breaker. You can't split stacks, it doesn't work even when you press shift and so forth.

So in the end I have two different skill trees in two different places that improves usage of one 'workbench' That's supposed to be constructive criticism so I have solution perhaps: To research cooking put it in research as culinary research, and everything related to campfire will be
in cooking tab under Campfire skill tree which divides into: Same goes for wood construction - if we want to make it clear
Let players activate wood construction through research and put everything related to wood construction in Carpentry tab

ideas-feedback,Permits | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1632/permits,463,1,1,Gates,I've not seen this mentioned or in game yet since I picked up ECO so I'd like to share this now for future law consideration. While I do like the ability to limit hunting and other gathering endeavors to X per player I feel it could be a lot better esp when you consider not everyone is hunting or tree chopping etc. I suggest an advanced goverment feature to allow for permits.  If a goverment forms on a planet that goverment can charge players for the right to take from public resources such as hunting.  A permit for example would let you hunt a total of X elk .  This way hunters wouldn't be as limited and can do what they want to do wland players who choose not to hunt don't have too.  It also gives better control for the player goverment to control the amount of resources being taken from the public eco system. Permits would need to expire after a set time to keep them from being horned so a player doesn't use 5 days of permits to go on a mass killing spree that the ECO can't handle. You can also do permits such as it is illegal to use a butcher table unless you have at least 3 efficiency to prevent accessible waste.  Illegal to chop trees without woodcutting 3 or a permit to cut 100 trees etc. A cap and trade permit might also be advised.  To use pollution generating machines you get a permit good for X pollution.  Using a machine would burn that permit much like a fuel and after so much pollution it becomes illegal to use the machine. These ideas are ment to help players specialize in their field since not everyone wants to go out and hunt their 2 elk or chop their ten trees.  Instead let the people who specialize in the field have 20 elk or 100 trees and let other players do what they want.  This of course is all optional as an additional goverment tool.

For example if you were to have a cart specially designed for carrying felled trees. Which would require a special tool(perhaps a rope) of some kind to drag slowly onto your cart.

While I wouldn't recommend merging too many ideas from other games I have seen an opening for where a conveyor could be used in the setting in which we find ourselves. Rather than have a replay of factorio in a 3d setting, why not have the capability of floating logs. While it's not the traditional conveyor system it is a viable way of transporting raw material by use of log flumes or chutes. Anyway, if someone else can visualize what I am saying, and if it's possible let me know with an upvote or a reply."

Idea have at least two new mechanics which are not implemented in game but may be required. I am looking for upvotes, feedback and logical constructive criticism.
This post will change to match my current knowledge / based on Your thoughts. An uncommon resource near/in lakes, ponds or at the seashore. Clay could be reformed into Ceramics by using Kiln. Clay could be reformed into Ceramics by using Furnace Proper clay hydration may be the key (water not implemented) == Probably like a dirt block but grey in colour == Workbench -> Potter’s Wheel (new Clay low tech workbench)
(Requires wood logs or boards to craft]
[Skills: Workbench craft -> Engineering Skill Tree]
[Pottery Skill Book: 30 lumps of Clay, 15 minutes, Research Table] Wooden Bathtub (requires water and clay)
Module for Potter’s Wheel or Clay Furnace which allows us to craft different Clay recipes Clay Molds
Those will be required before we start Casting == I understand that this idea might be imbalanced with Your current skill tree but perhaps a few swaps are required? Making charcoal can be harder if You: = Skill Tree option 1:
Engineering -> Pottery -> Pottery Speed -> Pottery Efficiency Skill Tree option 2 (hard):
Engineering -> Pottery ->Pottery Speed -> Pottery Efficiency
->Manufacturing -> Casting (?)[as a prerequisite or requirement] (Other options: Batching, Firing, Molding ecc.) == Clay can be used to craft decorations at the beginning and Ceramics later in the game
We could craft 'molds' as a modules for creating specific decorations/items/other New resources (let's pick something) - Polished Stone, Ceramic Glaze, Baking Stone, Stoneware, Earthenware
Alternative resource to Ceramics - Porcelain Glass bakeware - if we go this way we may end up with -> Industrial Enamel also known as Steel Glass
This may be good idea as You have nothing more for Glass at the moment, right? **Glass => Jars => Jam/Jelly (new cooking recipes) ** That's the Molecular Gastronomy entry which requires Plastics and Elk Wellingtons. Workbench crafted at Anvil with Blast Furnace (so it must be a lot of skill points to invest) or as community advanced to Steel Ceramic Furnace - requires brick room to work
Ceramic Tile Cutter - requires brick room to work or it is a module to a Ceramic Furnace or Furnace Ceramic tiles will be required to place new cooking workbenches Two new cooking workbenches: Modern Kitchen > Modern Sideboard/Buffet > Requires Ceramic Tiles
Modern Stove > Ceramic Cooker > Requires Ceramic Tiles This post will change to match my current knowledge / based on Your thoughts."

ideas-feedback,Tribes and local Populations. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1513/tribes-and-local-populations,2385,5,1,Assassin243,"Good Day fellow survivalists, Assassin here with another suggestion in regards to early game play. I have been playing Alpha 5.3 for about a week now, just moved to 5.4 this morning, loving the new improvements, keep them coming. As I have mentioned before I am playing on a small private server with a few close friends and as we have been playing we have been observing various mechanics that we would enjoy seeing in the game in the future. I have seen in the forums mentioned about Hydration, which I look forward to being a possible strong requirement for survival however what I am to purpose is more interactive. So the idea in a nutshell is to integrate a form of Native population of humans. Visually I see this in the form of possibly 2 or 3 'Tribes' scattered over the planet itself. Each Tribe ideally would be different in how they approach the world though in a primitive technical state much like early game with a few small wooden huts. These small tribes of NPC's would be able to be interacted with in a manner of making a rather empty world in the form of humans a tad more alive. These Natives would have 'control' of a local area around their small village in which they control the wildlife and vegetation within it. Players can interact with these natives to potentially gain trading options. However before this could be achieved I feel a form of Reputation would be required. Reputation can be represented much like a simple gauge, starting from neutral players can complete 'quests' presented by the NPC's in which they may seek assistance in a particular profession, perhaps in gathering wood or collecting a particular plant. In completing these actions Players will earn Reputation points filling their meter gauge into the positive for that Tribe. With Positive Reputation you can gain better and more fruitful trades with the local population, full access to use their land as well as being able to be trained in various low level skills. Now of course actions against the Native population namely the production of pollutants or 'stealing' resources within their Tribes lands without an appropriate level of Reputation can lead to negative Reputation which can have various consequences such as closing of all trades, bans on Players entering there local land and potentially leading to more destructive means in an attempt to remove your CO2 footprint. I have shaped this idea to make it more comfortable with this games core principles in saving the planet without damaging it in the process and as such we believe that if something like this was implemented then starting out in the world would be vastly more interactive especially if you choose to play singularly or in our case as a small group. It can allow access to various raw resources and some low tech skills such as Farming or Logging potentially allowing players to gain skills without having to pay skill points. I thank you for taking the time to read through my idea, hopefully we can bring forward a few more over the next few days and weeks I look forward to helping this game reach its full potential. Feel free to comment below with any concerns or additions, or if you would like me to clarify any details."

If tribe A: thought Bisons and blueberries were sacred. Perhaps the tribes will attack or simply refuse to trade with the players. As the tribe grows they will occupy more land. To enter their land a offering (logs,stone etc...)must be giving to them. Tribes also allow the game to implement a warfare skill tree... which Gives the game more of a challenge. players could attempt to exterminate the tribes. I believe the tribes should have unique items that can be traded for but will be lost forever if the tribe is exterminated. To prevent griefing waging war on tribes should be a law and must be voted upon. That's how I believe it should be implemented...anyone else have suggestions on how it can be improved?"

However I feel you have branched away from the core of this game with the incorporation of war and combat. You are working to save this planet not exterminate the natural inhabitants of it. I do not agree in a form of combat toward these Tribes, the core of this game is to work towards peaceful interactions and if these fail then you are locked from trading."
ideas-feedback,Tribes and local Populations. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1513/tribes-and-local-populations,2385,5,4,Benami,@Assassin243 I think you are misinterpreting my reasoning. The core premise of the game is to promote a healthy ecosystem. You don't have a game if you don't also impliment game mechanics that cause an unhealthy ecosystem. Warfare is most definitely an antagonist approach to a healthy and productive ecosystem. It causes pollution and destruction to the environment. Perhaps you didnt notice but no reward is gained by destroying the tribes apart from convenience. However...the consequences for eliminating them could be numerous. I feel the concept of this game is not about the rewards you get but about the consequences of our actions. Having a healthy ecosystem isnt easy...and nor should it be. Adding antagonistic mechanics makes us more responsible of our actions and have a better understanding of how to care for our planet. I am not advocating warfare as a positive thing....It should be implemented as a factor. Because how can you learn to care for the environment...without experiencing and seeing what is destroying it.

This is definitely something that given appropriate integration that should be considered into the main game as it does in any normal environment. As much as I personally would love to have some form of combat system in the game and all the additional skill requisites of warfare. At this current time this is a direction the developers do not wish to travel down for now. I hope in the future a Mod is created to add much of what we desire."

ideas-feedback,Visual aid | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1435/visual-aid,4214,11,11,Benami,I personally think adding a crosshair will degrade the experience. The less challenging you make the game the more players will become bored with it. If players can't hunt then they can choose a different skill and just trade for their food. The more missed shots by hunters the better...because they are burning calories. Skilled hunters will be successful others won't.. Putting a crosshair on the bow will make every single person an expert marksman. There won't be no challenge of hunting whatsoever. Please don't nerf this game with visual aids.

ideas-feedback,Water Requirement | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1490/water-requirement,1871,4,1,iflounder,The one thing this game is lacking from the food system all together is a need to stay hydrated. Now you could do this many ways including just connecting it to the normal system where it stops skill point gain and everything. OR you can do it as a sort of active booster. Meaning you give someone a 1.5x skill point boost or like a movement speed boost or something if they are hydrated. Then make it so you lose the boost in 30 mins or so. Like calories you burn water faster while you do stuff. This would allow someone who plays for like 4 hours to keep the 1.5x SP boost for 4.5 hours which is nice and gives people a reason to play more. You could add in items like canteens and things then so people have a portable supply of water.

And then I got the idea of customizing vehicles. Either some sort of table or bay where u could customize powered carts with engines, color, fuel capacity, how much it can carry and even shape. Like making ur cart look like a normal sedan or pickup. Like making your own brand of car. Or a table were u build the car from scrap with its own shape, form and all that jazz.

ideas-feedback,Warfare | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/611/warfare,4470,13,1,WillyMcBride,"Hello All! My name is Willy McBride, and I'm quite new to Eco - but i thought i'd share with you all an idea that has been in my mind for a while: and i think it would fit beautifully into what Eco is going for! That idea is the ability to wage war - or simply provide the tools of war that the players can manipulate. I think the first thing people will say is ""no"", because this game has been shown to be rather peaceful and about making a better world. However, history has shown that whatever humans do has an effect on the environment - and warfare (at least recently in the last few hundred years) has had a great effect on it. It has already been discussed that people can make different settlements with different laws and views, and again it is shown in history that people have disagreements: a lot of which were not first solved with diplomacy. People argue, and those arguments escalate. I can clearly envision a settlement (who has taken the greener path) upset over the opposite settlements anti-green ways, and how they are indirectly effecting them. This could be pollution from coal mines finding it's way into the waterways of another settlement, or massive encroachment on their land simply because they are desperate for certain resources. Sometimes people need to fight for what they love... Now, i am not saying i want this to turn into a Call of Duty actiony type game, oh no. Warfare would have a devastating impact on the environment, and on all of the living creatures in the world. But it would also give people an out to have some extra fun in the process. Again, i can picture miles of trenches separating the settlements from one another...the grass slowly becoming brown, and trees dying (or being blown up)...massive craters and death everywhere. But as i said before, people will fight for what they believe in - even more so if they are the ones being threatened. There is also the aftermath, when everything is settled and the settlements are again at peace. How will they divvy up the land and resources? How will they restore the war-torn land to it's original state? How will they convert military factories back into Civilian factories that once supplied the entire settlement with clothes, food, tools, ect. Will the people of either settlement show the same will and determination that they did during the war? Personally, i get really excited when i am confronted with scenarios like that. That's another thing about people. When they've realized that they've broken something, they do their darndest to fix it. That's what i'd like to do in this simulator. Have a lot of fun doing one thing, and then even more fun doing the other. Overall, these are things i'd like to see added into the game: Thank you very much everybody - and i hope you take this idea into account. Please be respectful in the comments! Cannot wait to play with you all, Willy McBride"
ideas-feedback,Warfare | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/611/warfare,4470,13,2,Starrik,"The biggest problem with this would be that it would act as a distraction from the aims of the game. It's supposed to centre around construction and cooperation; and when warfare is added to a game it tends to become the focus for a large number of players. I agree that warfare would add another level of depth, there's just the very good possibility that it would wreak havoc with the other aspects of the game There are a million and one warfare simulators, but the player driven economy and ecology that Eco is going for is, as far as I can see, is unique. I can't imagine anything worse than this being derailed into yet another warfare game. And the level of work needed to get that to wotk, and integrate wonderfully with the rest of the game- I just think other aspects of the game could be better served with the time and effort needed. tl;dr I see your point, but worry that it would dilute the essence of the game"
ideas-feedback,Warfare | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/611/warfare,4470,13,3,WillyMcBride,"I see your point as well. I am looking at it from a different perspective - a role playing perspective. I am very much under the impression that people do not always get along, and that like minded people tend to gravitate towards each other. But i do understand that the developers -want- people to cooperate: it's just that not every one wants to all the time. Warfare would have to have a a fail safe. I am not talking about the ability to attack whenever you want. I would suggest that, like laws, a settlement would vote on whether or not they want to go to war, and those they are attacking can vote whether they want to fight, or surrender and accept the other groups demands: but Warfare would not be a constant thing. You would have to have a majority vote, yes, but you could also say that a group has to have X number of weapons/people/supplies/ect. However i definitely agree that they should focus on what they have planned for the game already. I simply don't have the view that everyone always gets along and that a game should be built on that premise. In my experience, this concept becomes frustrating  for the minority of people who would fight (for reasons other then to troll) because they would be ganged up on politically, but would not actually be able to do anything about it other then leave the server and start over. I think the only way to tell whether this concept would dilute the game would be to talk to the developers about it and get their opinion, or simply put it into practice. But as you say, finish what they have planned for the game first!"
ideas-feedback,Warfare | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/611/warfare,4470,13,4,Starrik,"I'd argue that the ability to break laws, and to go against the existing rules, cheat, steal and be a bit of a rogue acts as a way for a lot of that frustration. I haven't been back since different settlements were able to have different laws set, but that seems to be designed to scratch the very itch you're talking about. If two settlements with different laws exist in conflict with each other, then by their very nature they will compete, over everything. Leaving out war, every resource and thing of potential strategic value, especially newcomers to the server, will be fought over except not with weapons. As it stands with the plans, settlements could wage a kind of warfare against each other by not punishing their own members for breaking laws in their competitor's settlement. (Side note: no idea how settlements are defined, or how exactly this system works. Been away a while.) In essence, I think I disagree that full blown warfare would be a good addition to the game just because I much prefer the idea of peaceful, but aggressive competition. Of course, as you said, it's ultimately up to the devs to decide what they think are the best additions to the game."

I think the possibility of war would add so much depth to this game. I understand that the original intent of the game was more focused on cooperation but in my opinion, you can't have true cooperation without an element of disagreement. Some things just can not be agreed upon and struggles will insue. Now I can see your concerns Starrik, but I think that can be alleviated with one concept; Wars are expensive. The whole premise of this game is dealing with finite resources. Bullets, guns, war machines? That's a lot of metal and other resources, not to mention time. Recourses that can't be used for other things. Then there is the ultimate ""resource"" (and in my opinion the biggest deterrent to going to war) human life. War is expensive in life and I'd say if you are to die it's a perma death you would have to start over."
ideas-feedback,Community Research. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1529/community-research,859,1,1,Assassin243,"Good Day fellow survivalists, Assassin here with another suggestion in regards to game play in general. I have been playing Alpha 5.4 for a number of hours now, still loving the new improvements, keep them coming. As I have mentioned before I am playing on a small private server with a few close friends and as we have been playing we have been observing various mechanics that we would enjoy seeing in the game in the future. One of the major aspects of this game is the community involvement. This is at the core of this game and its greatest mechanic, however progression does not join in with this theme. What I am referring to is Research. One major issue we have faced while working in a small net community of friends is that one or two individuals are forced to 'save' their Skill Points in order to gain the higher tier skills. Thus they are locked out of working towards a personal trade or perusing a trade until this higher tier research has been completed. What we would like to propose is that anything form of Research tab completed in the Research Table can be contributed by anyone. To explain this I'll use an example, say I want to unlock Culinary Arts, this requires me to first use my Skills Tab to unlock Advance Culinary Research, and then go to the Research Table add in the necessary Raw Resources to Create the Research Book for Culinary Arts. What we would like to propose is that for Core Research (Anything within the Research Tab of the Skills Menu) be completed in the Research Tab by going to the Research Table and adding Skill Points much like adding Raw Resources to complete the corresponding Research's Skill Book. So in the case of my Example in the Research Table I would place the 5 Prepared Meat and 10 Flatbread but also beside the cost of resources can be an additional Add Skill Points button (Perhaps in Blue 0/400) , This would drain form your Personal Pool to the Research Table depending on how many points you wish to contribute and once the necessary amount has been added then the Book can be Ordered as normal. Through this mechanic everyone can contribute their own Skill Points towards any given Core Research, thus allowing a more community involvement in overall tech advancement rather than having 1 or 2 of the group forced to wait to allow everyone to benefit. Since the Skill Book created can produce infinite Scrolls then everyone would benefit from contributing. It makes more sense to allow many hands to make the work load lighter, since this is the core of this game it would make sense that something to this extent could be considered. I thank you for taking the time to read through my idea, hopefully we can bring forward a few more over the next few days and weeks I look forward to helping this game reach its full potential. Feel free to comment below with any concerns or additions. I hope the core idea has be described though if not I am more than willing to explain in greater detail."

ideas-feedback,Stamina and possible intergradations. | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1491/stamina-and-possible-intergradations,922,1,1,Assassin243,"Good Day fellow survivalists, Assassin here with a suggestion in regards to early game play. I have been playing Alpha 5.3 for a number of days now with a few friends and we have been taking note of a few things we feel that if added into the game might make things a tad more realistic or otherwise improve the overall experience of the game itself. Now I have did my best to read through most of the previous suggestions below as to prevent possible reposting I do apologise if I have overstepped my position. Moving forward one of these mechanics we have noted from day one is the consistent movement speed, now of course this would encourage the use of the various infrastructure mechanics within the game namely Civil Engineering. However we felt that to fill the void between the starting few in-game days and reaching a point of easy road construction, the gathering of resources and other amenities can take some time if working singly or in our case a small number of friends. The idea at its core is to add in a form of Stamina ideally in the form of a Stamina Bar. This Bar would charge over a set period time, using a ball park figure of say 300 Calories over a 20 second time frame. Once a player wishes to say sprint then their Stamina bar would drop from 100% at a constant rate per second till they stop sprinting. This can allow for short periods of increased speed to all moving around the planet just a tad easier in the early days of development. Now of course this adds in an additional level of consideration to early gamely, do you invest valuable calories to move faster? Sprinting efficiency can differentiate depending on the terrain you are currently traversing, namely for dirt/grass you would be at say a default rate of 100%, sand or snow reduced to 70% and on surfaces such as roads increase uniformly in comparison to the material the road is made from so dirt roads, 120%, stone 140% and so on and so forth. Of course this also can lead to further additions in the form of researching Athletics, which would allow you to first increase the value of the Stamina bar, allowing say 340 Calories to be invested over the typical 300, leading from that Athletics can be made more efficient so far lees Calories are required to fill the Stamina bar and 'yield' (name pending) which would provide more bang for your buck, per say, allowing your Stamina bar to fall at a much lower rate per second for say sprinting. With this simple idea I feel more doors can be opened allowing thought into additional Athletic actions such as climbing and perhaps swimming. Or if to make the game a tad more realistic most actions would run through stamina rather than directly from your Calorie bar though personally I feel that this may pull away from the core idea of the game itself, however food for thought in this matter. I thank you for taking the time to read through my idea, hopefully we can bring forward a few more over the next few days and weeks I look forward to helping this game reach its full potential.

ideas-feedback,Specialization ideas | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1455/specialization-ideas,503,1,1,Testname,"Let me say this: I do not own the game (cuz 51$cdn) and I have not seen a running economy or really that much for that matter. I am just basing this off of what ive seen from videos, okay? I really see this game as a specialized world, similar to ours, or else whats the point of teamwork? let me start of with a few things that could increase specialization: 1: furniture quality.
say if you start a new game and craft a chest, you have next to 0 skills on creating it. It would be poorly built, with less space and carrying capacity. But as you get better in Carpentry and build more furniture or chests, your skills get better, increasing space and carrying capacity. People who want to go mining don't want to waste their time on carpentry, and rather buy it than make it. 2: personal traits.
What I mean is that you excel at some catagories or general work for something bad. You start out at 0 points, and you get a good trait.
you loose some points, and you trade it out for a bad trait. If it ends up more than 0, it just makes your good traits a bit more useful. for example, you pull carts faster for the trade off that it takes more hits to chop a tree and it's harder for others to use your scrolls (you need more skill points to upgrade something that was hard to read) 3: scroll change
as far as I know, you can make scrolls of books for free and instantly, so everyone can read.
I think it should take some time to make a scroll, and not free. And if someone else made the scroll, it might be harder to read (etc trait, or just naturally cuz u did not make it.) 4: Car overhaul
More engines! electric engines, desial engines, 2-stroke engines and 4-stroke engines. But also the shape of the car. If I'm correct, the shape of the car can increase or decrease fuel efficiency, I think because of aerodynamics. Whatever, its a bit far fetched. 5: Guns
optional in my opinion, but why not. thank you for getting at the bottom.

Conveyors are obviously a higher tech option, that should be at industrialization level. There should be some sort of low-tech alternative, but I can't think of any at this time.

The problem as I see it with a conveyor belt system would be the demand on system resources in an already complex environment. It wouldn't be so difficult to process on a gaming rig but seeing as the game is designed to be rolled out as an educational kit, and seeing as most educational institutions that I know of don't really spend big when it comes to their tech, this may be an issue.

When it comes to stationary storage, the building-level idea seems really cool.  I'd also eliminate ""slots"" in favor of lists and unlimited stack sizes (though you might have an overall capacity limit) to reduce the micromanagement for building-level storage of this type.  Making inventory ""realistic"" at the expense of usability and fun would seem like an anti-goal.  I'd also eliminate the notion of blocks vs. entities as a distinction for these storage types.  It seems to me to add nothing to the game/simulation. Having building-level storage still makes choosing where to store things important, and one could have ""warehouse"" buildings/modules which are more efficient (in terms of capacity) at storing things.  This keeps the transportation meta-game involved, particular with the likely future conveyor belts or similar autonomous transport methods.  Imagine a small town with several ""factories"" which automatically transport goods to a warehouse which is hooked up to a train station that pulls from there whenever a train comes to town. From a technical standpoint, automated transport a-la conveyors does not need to be computationally expensive.  The expensive part comes if you need to exactly simulate the movement of individual items to the client.  For example, BuildCraft in MC would show you exactly which blocks were where in the world at any given moment.  This accuracy is expensive, and possibly unnecessary.  There are more efficient ways to implement such a system while still retaining the interesting game elements.  Don't let fears of complexity prevent you from proffering ideas in this space."

ideas-feedback,Architecture skill and coopertive constuction improvements | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1416/architecture-skill-and-coopertive-constuction-improvements,1689,3,1,Aether,"An Idea I had on cooperative building in-game. It is currently difficult to coordinate projects with multiple builders, especially if they can't all be online at the same time. This is an aspect of game that fits the community spirit of ECO. It should be easier for many players to be able to contribute to large scale construction projects. I purpose a system to enable this sort of gameplay: ""Architecture"" Skill The main idea/goal is that buildings would be pre-planned before they are built. This may take the form of ""ghosted"" blocks, showing where blocks should be placed. Planning:
Someone with Architect skill, uses a Drafting Table (model could be similar to research table). Then, using the table interface, a design for building is created. Design happens inside a window UI. All blocks available would be on a side and a 3D grid representing the volume of a plot of land would be on other. The first block placed must be the 'keystone' block. This block represents the starting point of the building. More blocks then are clicked and dragged onto the grid to be placed. Once the design is complete, it is crafted into a 'blueprint' item (made with paper most likely).
Blueprints can be copied, with more paper, for mass production of buildings. Perhaps even modular designs could be made? Building:
Building site must be a claimed land plot. (this ensures consistency between the volume of the design, and the world.) It must also be completely leveled, and entire volume free of blocks. (this ensures that nothing from blueprint will super-impose on existing blocks. This should include things like overhanging tree limbs.)
""Blueprint"" is crafted into ""keystone"" block. ""keystone"" functions like a ""table/furniture object, that can only be placed on valid, empty land claim, that you have permissions to. it can be rotated with 'e' as normal, provided that it fits the volume of the plot. The ""keystone"" should 'ghost' image of entire building design.
Once placed, anyone with permissions to plot (or not?), can place the appropriate blocks on their ghosted image to build. 'Ghost"" image of individual blocks, or as a whole (or both?) should disappear after replaced by actual blocks. The advantage of this system is, design of building can be planned out by Architect. Then many builders can work, asynchronously, on construction over time. This is vital for large building projects! Everyone can see what final construction should look like, and there is no guess work. Some suggestions for Architecture Skill
Part of Civics tree?
Speed/efficiency on blueprint creation/copies
Increase to volume of land plots that can be used in design. (Lv1 1x1, Lv2, 2X2, Lv3 2X3, Lv4 3X3, Lv5 ?)
Limitation to blocks that can be used in design (wood, lumber, brick, concrete, etc) unlocked by skill? I realize this is a big feature suggestion, that would involve codding new systems, UI, etc. However, I think this is something that is not offered by other 'survival/crafting' games, that could set Eco apart in a way the emphasizes the cooperation, and community driven gameplay. I am interested to see what improvements and changes the community and developers can supply to make this idea a reality."

StarMade has a ""design-mode"" you can enter from the Ship Core which lets you freely move in 3-space (including through walls) in order to construct your ship.   But you have to have the resources to actually construct the ship.  Once done you can create a blueprint from that and then auto-create a ship or structure from that blueprint as long as you have the resources available.  The above suggestion is a sort of hybrid of these two systems it sounds like, except you wouldn't have to have the materials available to create the design, only to actually build it.

Being familiar with using Unity 5 I realize you can change a few default keys in the game splash window before it loads, however I would like to see the addition of all keys used in game. Key binding already in the menu as default by Unity:
W,A,S,D: Move forward, left, back and right
Space: Jump
(There are a lot more keybinds I saw that were not used in the game at all. I would use the input manager to delete these.) Needed key binding from the wiki that I did not see when trying to make changes:
E: Use object
Tab: Toggle UI Mode
Enter: Open chat / Send message
Esc: UI Mode / Game Menu
Left mouse button: Tool action
Right mouse button: Place Item / Use Item
E (while placing object): Rotate item left
Q (while placing object): Rotate Item Right
Shift + Left Mouse button: Split item stack (bugged in Alpha 0.5.1) Again I would like to add that having the ability to rebind keys in game would be really nice as well, though that UI construction in itself is kind of time consuming. Though, I would be initially satisfied with simply adding the keybinding to the splash screen by using the Unity Input Manager and changing code where appropriate. I believe using the Unity Input Manager should be sufficient to get the keys added to the keybind options in the splash screen:https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-InputManager.html You would need to travel through the C# code however and replace all of your Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.E) and etc.. with the correct information from the input manager. https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Input.GetKeyDown.html Being a left handed player I've spent a lot of time making sure keybindings where one of the first things I added in anything I made in Unity. here are a few tutorials I found while searching the YouTubes, though I don't know how accurate they are as I have not watched them:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MEHe0Uf3m4Ihttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STeOc8sBVL0 Lastly a question to the developers, Do you have an idea as to a time frame or when if at all the keybinding process would receive an overhaul?

I just finished posting up about a proposal for an electrical grid network and I could see this tying in with that idea by using the network to set up telephone lines and assign each player a phone number. You could even conference call multiple numbers. It could also tie in well with progression as you could eventually build reception towers and carry mobile phones about with you, rather than relying on a stationary telephone system. This would work really well in educational situations where gameplay is controlled and monitored, but probably not so much in casual play as people would probably just use a third party program for voice chat."

A power grid in which players link power nodes with cables in order to transfer energy from one place to another. A good example of design would be the Immersive Engineering mod for Minecraft or the Fallout 4 power system. The benefits of this system would be enriched immersion and an introduction to the basic concepts of electronics for students. Items Added Entities Added Crafting The Gameplay
The basic premise would be to build a Transformer and connect it to any power generating entity. Then, using Cables, you would connect the Transformer to a Fuse Box located on any building that you wish to power. As power would dissipate over the length of a cable network, additional Transformers can be used to extend the reach of the grid. The cable network can be hooked up to an ESU in order to store power, but this must then be fed back out into another Transformer before connecting to a Fuse Box. The Voltmeter tool can be used to test the current within a cable network and also the storage within an ESU. Final Notes
Please note that I really don't have any experience with electronics and everything I have come up with above is the result of some brief Google searching. Adjustments to crafting recipes should be made to improve upon realism and / or viability. You could even go down the mad scientist route of building super-conductor rods to harvest energy from lightning. I saw a suggestion somewhere about implementing a complete weather system with storms and seasons that could play in well with this.

At least, I haven't found another way to do it. So say I own a shop and I'm in need of Gold ore, and willing to trade for it. Then I need to make everything I'm selling in the store equal to the value of a stack of 10 gold ore or less, and then anything else I might also want to buy has to be in factors related to that gold ore. However, all that would need to change is that person's ""trade value"" units with a particular shop, which are already there for both the customer and the owner of the shop bench, be remembered by the server forever. This means that if say I wanted to sell a cart for 35 trade units, and I say that 1 log = 1 trade unit at my shop, a player can bring me 3.5 stacks of logs in 4 trips and would then have enough trade credit to buy a cart from me. It isn't a currency, but with the way that it works now where you lose your trade credit upon closing the shop window, all your trades can at best be 1 stack of something in value."

All of the animal carcasses have a low weight because, when they were added, we were unsure if we wanted to force them as a carried item and we really wanted to test butchery as an intermediary skill between hunting and food production. If we decide that this is indeed the way we want to continue with hunting, you can be sure that bison won’t weigh less than a seed. I can’t say I’ve shovelled a ton of dirt in my life (maybe a bit for landscaping), but I’d be amazed if anyone could carry a single cubic meter of dirt either in hand, on their back, or really any way that isn’t using some mechanical help. As with any game, there is a bit of disbelief that must be suspended and you can’t always take realism over fun, but in this case the idea that each block of dirt maintains its “space” can add a real sense of accomplishment to construction projects and enhance the need for transportation and cooperation. Being able to shovel more than one block of dirt is definitely a real possibility, but it’s unlikely it’ll be massive amounts (think a max of 10 like logs). Movement of these materials can be aided through said transportation (carts, etc) and is something we’re continually working on bugfixing. In the future we’ll be looking to store all blocks in a stockpile-like area that takes up actual space as opposed to the magical-space-creating chests we currently have. I do agree you move fairly slowly. I don’t agree that you should be able to catch animals; even Usain Bolt wouldn’t be able to catch an Elk in a foot chase. Hunting needs a look at and animal’s movement can’t be annoying erratic, but the actual speed of the player isn’t really the issue here. As you’ve stated, the movement for animals is currently not great. Running up cliffs? You’re right, they shouldn’t do that. If there was a checkbox that said “Animals can’t run up cliffs” you can be sure I’d check that box right away. Unfortunately it isn’t always that simple. Changing carry weight is definitely something we’re talking about. You don’t have to log off to get skill points; it happens even when you’re online. That isn’t really the point you were trying to make, but I just thought I should point it out as a potential misunderstanding. Regarding the meat of this point: an important aspect of the game is allowing players who cannot dedicate as much time to game as others can still contribute to a community’s success. Someone who can only manage an hour of gameplay every other day shouldn’t feel useless when playing with a group of people who can play dozens in the same timeframe. We may add a way to improve skills (mainly labor) through use, but right now it doesn’t quite fit perfectly. As with most things, server owners always have a the choice of increasing the multiplier for skills, etc to speed things up if their players really want an accelerated experience. As you said yourself, the game is in alpha. And because it’s in alpha we’re constantly making large changes to systems that are already in place to ensure that we create something that is both engaging and educational; sometimes this can cause older things to act wonky, become irrelevant, or break entirely. These changes don’t always work exactly as planned and we don’t always catch everything that didn’t go 100% right but that’s why we really appreciate all feedback."

This also spares the ecosystem which you need to take care of - don't cut trees down randomly! I already did this twice and it works perfectly. Just find yourself a cliff and start digging!

ideas-feedback,MANY ideas on: Skill gaining variables / professions (check the TL;DR section for a summarized version) | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1306/many-ideas-on-skill-gaining-variables-professions-check-the-tl-dr-section-for-a-summarized-version,2191,4,1,Ixidon,"WARNING: I present various ideas that some of them came up while writing this. Check the bottom for a summarized, short version! ** They way I see it, there is a big issue with the skill progression of the game so far. As many non-new players probably have noticed so far, food is very, very important. The difference from t2 to t3 food is ~ 100 points/day, while from t3 to t4 is ~ 140p/day. Food is need for (A) fuel for laboring and (B) skill gain. So, anyone that wants to do some labor, needs to eat a lot of food (even with skills related to efficiency, you'll still need to eat 2, 3 or 4x more food that someone that does not do any labor. So, as you can understand, food has a HUGE value in the game, since it's an everyday, highly valuable, consumable item. So, unlike all other professions, a chef literally controls the markets, and the only way to break this power is either via competition (more people entering this profession) or via trade embargo (force him to  drop prices or else have zero access to other people's craftsmanship), which it's very, very hard to enforce,  for obvious reasons. To better comprehend such differences, let me use a simple example: Tom eats t2 food and has 150 points/day. BIlly eats t4 food and has 370p/day. After 3 days, Tom will have gained 450p, while Billy will have 1100p. Tom is bound to become obsolete as the tech of their servers evolves, since he'll simply won't have enough points to be really relevant to the end-game phase of the game (where you skills costs are very high due to exponential growth). So, Tom has either trade stuff with Billy for food, or give him materials to prepare him some good food. BUT, the problem is that no profession (as far as I know) has such a high demand for consumable products, so, eventually, no matter what Tom has to sell to Billy,** Billy eventually will nothing that he needs from Tom**. Meaning, Tom will be able to get food via trading the raw food required for the high tier food preparation, meaning he'll partially have to change profession (mostly invest into gathering skills in order to harvest more food units per foraging/hunting action), meaning less points to spend into high tech skills AND** less time to focus on other products** (since you have to do the foraging / laboring tasks). And this is the without taking into consideration that the Billy (the chef) might want to abuse his power and raise prices to an abnormal lvl. In the end, Tom, in order to be able to keep up with the high tier tech / projects, he must either become a laborer (= work for others / partially work as a forager to be able to afford his daily high tier food, which, consequently will lead to more laboring/foraging, since laboring consumes calories, thus in need of more food consumed per day. What are my problems with this? 1. It's unrealistic. Chefs never held such power in any part of human history.2. It's imbalances the game too much. Although I understand that this problem can be solved through the forces of the market (Supply / Demand), meaning if a chef is too expensive, other chefs will pop up to steal a % of the other chef via reduced prices, it still does not solve the main problem, which is the nature of cooking products, meaning (A) **high value **and (B) daily demand, combined with the fact that  all other professions do not have such a guaranteed demand for their craftsmanship. (as I explained in my initial example). Communities will find a way to work around this, but this does not make it any less bad. - SUGGESTIONS IN GENERAL: 1.Add more functions to the other professions so that they can keep being relevant in the long run. For example: Add furniture that affect it, like, let's say a bed or a painting or the material of structure of your house (maybe upgrading from logs to mort stone or bricks will provide better heat insulation,  which increased your personal prosperity, thus it should affect your skill gain ratio ((perhaps you can simple not change the whole wall, but just upgrade the blocks of each material into ""insulated status"")). Which it makes sense: Your personal prosperity & health are not only related to the quality of the food you consume. I can feed high quality food a homeless person but he'll still be miserable and have a chance to get sick / die due to exposure to bad weather (cold / heat, rain/snow, etc). You could also add attrition as another variable. Roads, tools, machines always need maintenance and / or repairing. That will mean provide professions with more regular demand for their services. Lastly, we could add a health variable. The more healthy you are, the better you'll function. How I define being ""Healthy""? One idea that just came up with: Food poisoning: If pollution gets too bad in your ecosystem, not only animals will start to die eventually, but you might also eat something that has been poisoned by the pollution, thus making you sick. Once you receive the status ""Food Poisoned"", you can perhaps get a** % penalty** in the skill gaining ratio or other types of penalties, such as % penalty in your movement speed / % penalty in your max calorie storing capabilities (let's say that from 3000 calories max it falls to 1000 max calories, so this way it'll be harder for you do do any laboring, which makes sense, since sick people tend to be weak). As you can imagine, this leads to a creation of** A NEW PROFESSION: Doctors!** It should be a profession that starts are something like a botanist, who can create simple botanic medicine, then later evolve into a doctor, who will be able to use more complicated medical machinery (= more demand for various crafting professions).
Again, as you can imagine, this creates another concept: The usage of plants not only as food but also for other reasons, whether it's medical or any other idea we can come up with. TL;DR VERSION HERE:
List of other suggested ideas / changes: more variables related to skill gaining ratio:- PHYSICAL PROSPERITY: bedroom & personal furniture, insulation of bedrooms- MENTAL PROSPERITY: Aesthetic items such as paintings etc, or luxurious clothing items.- HEALTH / MEDICINE / DOCTORS- MORE FUNCTIONS FOR MOST PROFESSION- REPEATABILITY OF CERTAIN SERVICES That's it for now. :) Discuss and share any potential improvements to my initial ideas and/or post your own suggestions!"

The goal is to push the other professions into line with cooking so that they're all (roughly) equally useful to a community. Everyone should be able to produce something other people need/want doing whatever job they find the most appealing. While this certainly isn't the case currently, the chef does provide an extreme example of this. We're looking into adding similar useful consumable items (or just used in consumable crafting) to push the rest of the professions up a bit. The ""labor using calories ->  eating more"" problem is likely going to be addressed with a new skill changes; namely buffing the calorie reduction skills. We've always wanted there to be a sort of divide between the specializations and if a chef wants to go out and build a new house, it should be cheaper (from a material/'value') to pay someone else to do it. On a side note, I really like the idea of personal property affecting a player's skills/etc."

Moreover, another idea I had about the calorie consumption issues, is to add a new mechanism: EXHAUSTION What it'll do: If you over do it with labor (read calorie consumption), then your body will get exhausted, which will lead to some kind of penalty. Perhaps it's like a significant increase in calorie consumption rate for every action (let's say +50%, meaning any action you do from now on until this effect expires, will cost +50% calories). Or, it could affect your skill gaining ratio (let's say, due to exhaustion, for the next 12 hours you gain skills with a -20% penalty). This will help in 2 ways:"

This is not something I would define as an in-game tutorial(or at least a finished one), but it should at least help users get started on the game. HUD is very tedious to work with.
-provide a key for the inventory and minimap rather than unlocking the mouse and clicking it. Somewhat annoying fade in/out of the HUD options.  When I press escape or check backpack, I would like to access the menu quickly.  If there is a need to take a moment to open up something like a backpack, then put a timer on it, but not a fade-in HUD; it's a huge waste of time. Provide more in-game options:
-mouse sensitivity(default currently too fast in my opinion, had to lower before playing)
-more graphic optimization options (grass, sky, water, tree, etc.) Other Notes
Hotbar scrolling is ""inverted"" to that of popular games such as Minecraft, which can lead to very confusing controls when transitioning between the two.  This is just a note for some audiences that end up playing both games. Deeper Oceans

-No crosshair when placing dirt or building in general, can sometimes place wall/dirt on the wrong spot."

ideas-feedback,Some thoughts on: Private / Public storage & Agriculture / planting | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1246/some-thoughts-on-private-public-storage-agriculture-planting,1911,4,1,Ixidon,"Alright, here's some ideas that can enhance the gameplay: PRIVATE & PUBLIC STORAGE. Tier: MAJOR Problem: Suppose you have tons of materials and you ask someone of a profession you have not gained any skills to make you a higher tier item (e.g. make you bricks or make you high quality food, etc). You'll give them the materials and they'll give the order to construct them but once the order is completed, YOU CANNOT ACCESS THEM, since they are stored in the PRIVATE storage facility of the creator. So, to gain access to the items you requested, the creator must (A) be online to give them to you (B) have the will and time to come and give you all your items, (C) you to be online, and (D) you to be available to go and get them from him. Now, imagine this happening with not only 1 person (ordering something), but 5, 10, 15. Obviously, not sustainable. Solution:
Create an option before you click the 'order' button to add extra/remove ownership of that item. What will this function do? It will allow the said players to have access to these items in your PRIVATE storage (which is where your creations are stored), so you can skip all A, B, C and D conditions. P.S. This could be potentially solved via a well functioning trading system, which currently does not exist. Right now, the whole section of agriculture is in a very messy state. Problem:
Is X referring to any EXTRA plants that the land can sustain? WHICH 4X4 tile are we talking about? There are no marked borders, so it's pretty much guessing. If I don't know which is the land it is referring to then the X,Y info is pretty much useless (since they change whenever soil conditions change).
I think farming will be very undesirable as a profession based on its current state (since you'll get lots of dead crops simply because you planted more plants that the undefined ?x? Land could support. Solution:
Create a 'zoning' mechanism related to farming/planting that you toggle on whenever you want to do some planting.
It can be a locked function that you unlock and can toggle on once you have certain skill and/or have equipped a, let's say, soil sampler.
It should project BORDERS (again, the borders should have a variety, like 4x4, 10x10, 20x20) that will be focused on the tile your mouse is pointing at. That way, I'll know EXACTLY which tiles have mentioned agricultural characteristics. Solution:
Put an option in the Scythe to WHICH PLANTS it can target. So, let's say you want to grab only wheat. you click ""deselect all"", then click 'wheat'. I might add more ideas related to this in the future."

But there are pioneers like Masanobu Fukuoka (1913-2008) who developed ways of growing grain crops in amongst fields that hadn't be cleared with herbicides or plough. He must also have had a way of harvesting the crops without getting too much else mixed in with the grain heads. I think he promoted ground cover plants so soil was always covered (which is better for soil biota and nutrient) at all times of the year and planted his seeds for both winter and summer crops at the same time in small clay seed balls (these stopped birds eating the seeds when they were sown). The barley and rice (he used a non-flooding soak method to get it started and didn't grow it underwater at any stage less water resource demand and less methane fugitive emissions as it happens) would have reached up above the ground covers. The ground covers in turn prevent domination by 'weeds' (unless the soil is really lacking in something in which case a weed will invariably get established and dominate to restore that mineral or nutrient). I'd love for their to be sophisticated options for organic, biodynamic, biological and permaculture farming/land management methods. Fukuoka was an agronomist before returning to the land as a farmer and perplexed his former colleagues by growing crops with yields that were better than the Japanese industrial farming benchmarks without any fertilizers or even mechanical tools/tractors! The used to say 'if you just added this or that fertilizer/pesticide the yields would be even better' — not understanding that such interventions would have reduced soil activity/bio-available nutrients and productivity and harmed the yields."

Things die seemingly at random and its very difficult to get anything to grow properly. As for how it's going to change: the goal is to return farming to a usable state for everyone while providing a way for dedicated farmers to outproduce and min/max to their hearts content. If you want to just throw down some wheat in a field, it should work (provided you don't try to plant wheat in a tundra or desert) but it certainly won't be ideal. For players who want to really farm, a soil nutrient system (on top of the temperature/moisture that already exists) will allow players to produce significantly better if they take the time to balance and manage their farms. Of course this also will include a way to visualize the zones so you aren't just looking at a bunch of confusing numbers (although those numbers will still be accessible)."

ideas-feedback,The storage system and transferring items | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1251/the-storage-system-and-transferring-items,2736,2,1,Nes,"When I first learned about ECO, I remember reading ""In ECO, you can only move realistic amounts"". Well, this is true except when moving item stacks around. Say you collect 50 stone and put it in your cart. 50 stone weighs 1,500kg, which seems like a heavy cart to pull by hand, but let's put that aside. You then can pull your cart right up to a crafting station, open both inventories, and with a few clicks and drags, your resources are in the crafting table. You've moved 1,500kg in a matter of seconds! This is so efficient that it practically requires buildings to be built a certain way: crafting stations must be next to windows or doors adjacent to roads, so carts can pull up next to them. I noticed in Alpha 5 that an object's storage window will disappear at a shorter distance from that object than in Alpha 4. Seems like this was an effort to address the issue, but it's only forced us to smush our crafting stations and roads closer together. The alternative is to transfer every block of stone one by one (if we didn't have the 10-blocks-on-a-shovel bug). This is comparatively tedious, but if I had to pick between this and quick item transfer, I would go with this because it makes more sense in the context of the rest of the game. Please note that the issue also applies to non-block items. I can click-and-drag stacks of 100 ingots (400kg) between inventories as well. If this was not possible, I would be clicking and dragging the ingots, 5 at a time, from one inventory to my backpack to another inventory. This sounds even more tedious than moving the stone, and makes me wish I could pick up, carry and drop these items in my hands in the same way that block items work. @Metachronism mentioned his plans for a new ""stockpile"" system, so maybe this will bring big changes to how resources and items are moved. But it has to address this issue. Once stockpiles are implemented, I think a happy medium (between the tedious ""one-block-at-a-time"" and the efficient inventory transfer) could work something like this: My understanding is that stockpiles would be for block items only, so this does nothing for moving around large stacks of non-block items. Maybe non-block items should continue working this way, or maybe they should be able to be added to stockpiles as well. I don't know all the answers, I just feel there is a better way of doing things than relying on the all-too-effective inventory transfer."
ideas-feedback,The storage system and transferring items | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1251/the-storage-system-and-transferring-items,2736,2,2,Ixidon,"That's something I also got frustrated while playing. I've made 'garage' next to my house's windows so I can unload everything into chests/worknbenches. Still, it's annoying to have to drag and drop every stack (usually of 10 units). I would like it to happen not only to happen automatically, but to also have a filter function lie ""move these types of unit into X storage unit"", which can be clickable. That being said, if you want to keep it more realistic, you can add a timer for each loading/unloading you do, which will be based on the kg of you cargo you are moving. So, it still requires you to ""spend"" time, you just don't have to do the tedious drag & drop."

ideas-feedback,A few thoughts | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1226/a-few-thoughts,3690,9,1,Nes,"Hi all, I've been playing ECO since Alpha 4, and i've got many hours played in Alpha 5. I really love the game and I hope it succeeds. Environmental issues are a big deal to me and I think this game is really going to fill a gap in the market. I just thought I'd write down some of the thoughts I have about the ingame systems. Apologies if these ideas are already planned or have been discussed to death somewhere else. The division of labor in ECO is really interesting, but it's caused situations for me where I have to wait around on the server for someone to come online and ask them ""Hey could you make x amount of <insert thing here> for me?"" It would be really nice to be able to put in ""work requests"" at a workstation. Perhaps all workstations could have an extra tab, called ""requests"". The person placing the work request would have to provide the materials for the item first, and would have the option of providing incentive item(s), rewarded to the crafter once the job is done. Items made in this way should probably show up in the requester's private storage to prevent theft. This would make a big difference in lubricating the wheels of commerce in ECO, and in mitigating the requirement for people to be online concurrently. Of course, maybe the goal of the classroom iteration of ECO is to get students to talk more and communicate verbally, in which case this system could be disabled. Right now, this skill is almost completely useless. It only takes several skill points for players to get one of every basic tool, and those tools will last them the whole game. To remedy this, tools could be split into two tiers. A basic tier, obtainable through initial skills and craftable at a workbench, and a superior tier, craftable at the anvil. The difference in tiers could be fewer calories used or more blocks carried at a time, but I think a better idea would be to introduce a durability mechanic. Superior tools would last much longer than basic tools. This would keep the tool market active by requiring players to replace their tools regularly. There are some building elements that are rarely used. A prime example is roofs. In the server I play in, I haven't seen a single structure that has a roof block on it. Everything is just boxes made of logs. The lack of roofs makes the buildings look a lot less interesting. I see two ways to remedy this: One or both of these could be implemented. Unfortunately, I think there is a bit of a failure in communication as to what actually constitutes good food in ECO. Part of this is because there's no tutorial or in-game guide telling players that more-processed food is more nutritious, but another part is simply how the food tooltip is displayed. Take Wheat for example: It has 60 carbs, 150 calories, and no other nutrients. When I first saw that, I thought, ""Wow, 60 carbs and only 150 calories! That's nutritious!"" But really, the average nutrients (and therefore the effect on skill gain) is only 15, because it contains 0 fat, protein and vitamins. I was also surprised to learn that the nutrient:calorie ratio has no bearing on how nutritious a food is. One thing I think that could be done is to display the ""0"" amounts of nutrients in the tooltip, to better reflect how that food is actually going to affect skill gain. This is one of my biggest concerns for the longevity of ECO. A game is supposed to last 30 days, but to keep a game like this going - outside of the classroom - players need a greater sense of purpose and permanence. Perhaps some players will find enjoyment in the sandbox, and put their effort into building aesthetically pleasing cities while living in harmony with nature. But, a lot of people are going to get bored with the game very quickly. Fortunately, I think this is where the mod support has huge potential to pay off. The ecosystem simulation will be absolutely key to the endgame, and it's what sets ECO apart from other games. If the ecosystem is engaging and dynamic, players will remain interested long after the meteor is blown up. I really hope that more love is given to the ecosystem side of the game. I'm sure it will. That's all for now. I've been loving ECO and I hope to see more people in the game. Thanks for reading!"

Initial contracts will be transport, building, and crafting, and it will pretty much work exactly as you described.  Almost done with it. Very good point, I like this idea. @craig-jong whatcha think, would be an easy addition I beleive. Also agreed.  We have discussed a hammer that lets you craft items in place like roof tops, so its easier to build them. Adding a requirement for them would be easy as well. Take Wheat for example: It has 60 carbs, 150 calories, and no other nutrients. When I first saw that, I thought, ""Wow, 60 carbs and only 150 calories! That's nutritious!""

One thing I think that could be done is to display the ""0"" amounts of nutrients in the tooltip, to better reflect how that food is actually going to affect skill gain. Good point, and the food system is something we've iterated on a lot. Originally it was 'total nutrients' consumed, but there were lots of problems with that which made us switch to 'average' (ie, eat lots of garbage food, do all the work you need, then eat the good stuff before you logoff).  I agree presenting this better is very important. Agreed here as well. Mods will be a big part of longevity/replay, as well interesting simulations.  Replaying with different groups should yield pretty different results too.  We're also going to build a connected exo-planet colonization game that will let you build a spaceship on Eco and go into this new game if youve bought it to terraform another planet.  This game will be called Exo and just got funded by the NSF (you heard it here first, shhh). That will add a lot of end game interest. I like it, as a general goal I like everything to have a gameplay purpose beyond aesthetics, and light falls into this category. I dont want to incentivize players to walk around in the dark to save resources.  @craig-jong  this could be easily done by making lights modules for tables.  We should get that system nice and easy to add stuff like this. Thanks a lot for the feedback all, really helpful to discuss this."
ideas-feedback,A few thoughts | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1226/a-few-thoughts,3690,9,7,Gronknor,"I've only been playing for a few days now. I've played several different survival games, creativerse, minecraft, trove, how to survive.. to name a few, so I'm not diving into deep uncharted waters without some prior knowledge of a ""survival game"". I know this is really early development and feedback is essential for growth of your game. From what I've gathered, in some frustrations, the game play isn't consistent, no experience gained while doing same tasks to progress faster. I'm having to wait for each game day for 1 point or several to level up a skill that could potentially either hinder my operations, or set me on a new adventure. There really isn't any other faster progression aside from waiting for skill points. Which if I was a school student, it would be glorious, as when I would return the to game, I would have skill points to administer. It seems, at the games progression now, you don't really gain much experience working. I mean logically if you cut enough trees down, you gain knowledge, granting experience to allow you to work more efficiently placing points to make workloads seem effortless and streamlined. As with a possible real life situation, a basic campfire, finding wood, and making a structure shouldn't be grand task as that is basic survival, should be pretty quick and effortless. Like perhaps in the future a tutorial explain what certain skill sets do, and how it would maximize their workloads and play-ability. Skill tree needs descriptions as to why this said person needs to put points into it to progress, or a description stating they need this first before being able to apply points in this said skill tree, eliminating a stalemate on progression upon wasting points on something that person cannot use immediately. Also, the elimination of the need for a deed for every item separately could possibly reduce visual and script lag. Personally I believe that once you've placed down the first claim plot, any plot afterwards (unless changed while standing on that plot) to inherent permissions set by the Father plot. This would significantly reduce the need for a deed for every item that has a possible storage (unless permissions on that said object are changed otherwise). Also should be able to see visual claim plot borders to maximize the claim plots, and not overlap them, wasting claim stakes for only half of a plot. There really isn't a solid visual indicator aside from a variation of color through the coordinates on the mini map to indicate plots you've obtained. For now it's a guessing game when farming, in hopes you do not farm in a public area and loose half of your crop to someone else because it borders or overlaps public domain. From what I've gathered thus far, yes this game is in an alpha stage, still a lot of work to do. However, I would like to see more in the lines of experience when repeating work, as if you're burning calories, doing the same task, you should gain more experience, knowledge to make the workload seem less tedious, and more meaningful as you progress. rather than having to wait 12 hours to progress to gain enough points to unlock a skill-set desperately needed to progress in the very beginning. As for the map, it's a nice touch, but it's quite laggy. And believe me when you have the map, and the chat window and your backpack open you can bet to see somewhere in the lines of 6-8fps if not less while they're active, if not a complete crash to desktop all together. A flat topographical map, or a ""satellite image"" wouldn't be a bad idea, with an option for a more rounded, animated map if your system can handle it. Now with clipping, or moving up a stair like terrain, it's not an easy task, shouldn't be difficult to walk up 1 block, unless the measurement of 1 block is like a meter squared, then I could understand why you couldn't. We should be able to hold some stones while we're mining in our backpacks, and this still goes on with the knowledge and progression of the said person, doing the same tasks will eventually make you stronger, thus being able to handle a larger load to carry back. These are some things i've ran into whilst playing, I'll be sure to find more as I progress. Thanks for allowing the opportunity to purchase and try your game out, it's quite nice to look at, the textures are spot on, and beautiful. i love the lighting, and how the light casts on the ground and/or walls you've built. Just needs some solid optimization for different graphic cards. Thanks again, Gronknor."

Staying focused on Eco, though, I'm glad to hear about your plans for contracts and a revamped lighting system. Obviously you've anticipated these issues. Regarding food, I think that the system is pretty good where it is now. It just needs to be explained to players a little better. One interesting thing the system causes now is a division between laborers and ""skilled"" workers. Players who perform manual labor a lot will need to eat more food to replenish their calories, and unless there is a constant supply of the most nutritious food, their skill gain will not be as good as those who simply eat a few portions of the most nutritious food available and don't do any manual labor at all."
ideas-feedback,[Suggestion] In-Game Daily Newspaper | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/399/suggestion-in-game-daily-newspaper,4215,9,1,cubewiz,"The skill and trading systems, the importance of knowledge, and the need to maximize efficiency to succeed in Eco mean that players will need strong communication mechanisms.  Teamspeak, in-game chat, and web fora are all great, but what is needed is a common place to advertise trades, announce village formation, discuss government and policy on the way to creating law, etc. in a format optimized for the game. I suggest adding a Daily Newspaper feature as part of the web UI.  The newspaper could be updated every day and contain a combination of: Certain kinds of reports, and/or the existence of the newspaper could be dependent on development of some kind media infrastructure or communication technology, and there could be skills associated with various aspects of it.  It might be possible to create laws that affect production, distribution, or consumption of the news. I think a well-done paper could make in-game communication fun and efficient.  It would be great for catching up if you've been off the server for a couple of days. I also think it would be nice after endgame (whether won or lost) for players to be able to download and keep the news archive as a souvenir of the experience.  Also along these lines, imagine if post-game you could look at a record of the news alongside actual recorded stats of the health of the world (stats that were perhaps unknown or not seen as significant at the time) and try to evaluate what went right or wrong in terms of what was known or how it was communicated. To me, Eco is ultimately a simulation to test whether a community can come together and resolve differences in time to solve an existential problem while protecting a delicate and complex ecosystem.  Just as in real life, success is going to require successful communication above all else, so it seems to me that communication should be an integrated and recorded first-class aspect of the simulation.  Certainly out-of-band communication can get the job done, but the game has many opportunities to enhance, encourage, standardize and archive communication among its players."

I agree animals such as the wolf should pose a significant threat to the player in the game as they would in life which inturn would force the player to kill more wolves. These wolves should be given set territories in which they hunt, in doing this if the player were to kill some wolves in an area then inturn the territory they were in would become safe for a period of time until new ones spawned. This would make killing predators actually reward the player more than just some meat which inturn would add more depth to Eco's gameplay.
The main thing I'd like to see in Eco, is a proper food web of different species of animals like in real life which sometimes have hundreds of different species, instead of the incredibly basic food chain which is in Eco at the moment which could have been made by a child in primary school.
Anyway pretty much the main reason people preserve the ecosystem in real life is to protect the thousands of species of animals in the world and honestly being able to count all Eco's animal types on one hand is definately not a good thing for an ecosystem simulator, even if it's in alpha. Plus the animals are so GENERIC and boring, if those were the only animals in the real world I honestly wouldn't even care if the environment was healthy or not."

Starting as a new player is hard, because its not easy to find the skilltree.
and also its hard to get started at all, because if i put the first skills as it would be logical, i cant do anything.
so may be more help in what i have to skill. well, if i hover over the whole skills in first line, its simple to get it, what to skill, but a hint for that, would be nice, so its better, more easy to start the first steps instead of frustrate the player to give up the game. thats it from me for now. goin further testing now :-) but anyways, goot job till now!"
ideas-feedback,[Feedback] Workflow not seamless | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1175/feedback-workflow-not-seamless,948,2,2,craig.jong,"We agree that the switching between mouse and the ""game""-mode needs a lot of work. The closing of menus with escape and accessing common menus through hotkeys (ie M for map, I for inventory, etc) is definitely something we'll be doing, however I can't say exactly when. As for world interaction, that's something that gets iterated and changed a lot. We used to have a much more intrusive cursor, but we found it extremely irritating when attempting to do normal tasks. What we have definitely isn't final and we're planning on having a ""ghost"" image of the blocks you're placing similar to that of workbenches in the future. Once again you're right about the skills menu: it's very difficult to find and skilling the 'correct' thing for a solo player can be difficult without reading the tooltips. I definitely agree we could add some guidance here so that players might be able to get into the game faster. However the game isn't really intended to be played by yourself and adding a set of recommended skills (whether it be by highlighting them, or some other means) would really homogenize the starting players. Not everyone needs to be able to log well, or even at all, if you work together."

My idea is that different biomes and areas in the world can have special and rare resources that groups of players on large population servers can capitalize on and take for themselves thus having control over a resource in heavy demand from towns and other settlements that do not have access to the resource like Deserts and parts of the sea having deposits of oil for vehicles and factories, Certain hills and mountains having access to larger deposits of a specific mineral than others and the list can go on. What this could enable is a higher need for trade and barter between players and communities and also another challenge for players to tackle with protecting the planets eco system! Even if it wont be included in the finished game this still seems pretty moddable :)"

Unfortunately being Australian and a poor student, terrible currency conversion rates mean I won't be able to pick up the game for a while yet (one day, one day). Forgive me if I mention anything that has been posted before, I haven't scanned through the whole board so it's entirely possible but I wanted to talk about future skill trees. I had a look on the wiki through the current skills which already looked awesome and I can't wait to see people specializing into their different branches but I noticed a lack of a skill tree I would personally love to see. Considering how heavy the emphasis is in eco to manage the ecosystems of the planet to achieve balanced progression, will there be skill trees focused on environmental research and ways to implement them as a profession? For example: I understand that all players get access to the eco stats, allowing all players to be involved in decision making and the like however I think it would be cool to be able to say.. Be hired by the government or some player organization to specifically go out and research wildlife diversity or something of the like and trends, spending majority of their time working with the data to present to said organization a report to base the laws/formulate construction plans from. Like in real life, business minded players may not have the time (or if there were skills or equipment researchable that in of itself took time to develop) to do such research themselves and as such, a profession focused on being able to provide analysis of that data relating to their needs would be very interesting. That's just my two cents and is bias by the fact that when I get the game, I would love to be able to go out and study the world with what could be a specific skill set which would allow me to sell my research and make a living as opposed to simply doing it on the side and say.. baking or farming for money. Hope to hear some discussion from other current players and maybe even the devs on ideas like this."
ideas-feedback,Are humans a keystone predator? | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1100/are-humans-a-keystone-predator,2413,4,1,Baneofpuppies,"Are humans keystone predators in ECO? Biologist Dr. Charles Kay makes the argument that in the past, native people have always made significant impacts on the environment. When I usually think of conserving the environment, I think that humans have messed things up and part of conserving ecologies means that we have to fix our messes. If humans had never been here to mess things up, the wilderness would go back to a natural, beautified state.
However, I came across an article suggesting that there may be more to this than meets the eye. That in fact, rather than re-introducing all the 'natural' animals, plants and rodents to an ecology making it all go back to being balanced; that without humans constantly ""interfering"" it may become unbalanced(see this paper).
The paper suggests that Native people were apex predators, and that without their hunting and gathering their lands it would throw off the ecology.
My question is this: Would the ecology of an ECO world fail if humans never played? Would Elk be wiped out if humans refused to hunt any wolves? In other words, would bison start destroying all plant life and spreading disease to livestock if humans simply ""left them alone"" and let ""nature run it's course"" (like is currently happening in Yellowstone?) Also, see here for more details on impacts that increased bison populations have on the environment. Basically, they need more space; without humans culling the populations they would destroy the food supply.
(also, the articles are not reflections of my personal opinions--just thought they were interesting starting points for questions about ecology)"

Then we realized that we got something about a town that is interesting: Pre-requisite: Idea
(Town) (Government) User Stories (things that I would like to enable): (Government)
a) As a gov-officer (or citizen), I would like to see aggregated and historical data about how species are doing in my control region (government controlled territory), so that I can maintain sustainability b) As a citizen (of a government), I would like to vote for laws for the government I belong to. c) As a citizen, I would like to build wall and fences to indicate controlled territories d) As a officer, I would like to collect taxes from my citizen to fund the public sector. ================
Other possibility varieties: ================
Risk and uncertainties:
So far, the building type is very interesting to me (kitchen and bakery from alpha 2 for example), because they now serves a purpose than meaningless decorations.
However, what I don't really get is.
Is building function / bonus based on ""Room"" or entire ""building""? In other words, I can see that a ""kitchen"" is a ""room"" at ""home"" which is a ""building"". Kitchen provides functionalities to make meat but ""home"" is said to provide bonus hunger duration and stuff.

I mean it would be a while if they did.  As is right now I am using it multiple times per day sometimes hours.  And I still have it in my head that this game will have nothing to do with the player dying ever.  I think of it as a Game about creativity and learning.  Aswell as learning to communicate and work with other people.  All these aspects will not be ruined with the unstuck command.  It's not a competitive game and not pvp so if the unstuck command stayed forever it wouldn't effect a thing.  Not sure if it will but I don't see why it would be removed.  Like I said I like the idea of having to clean up or something a collapsed cave but I don't think it should effect the player directly by death or being stuck. Maybe effect the planet somehow or just force the player to clean up to continue a tunnel or w.e

But you're going to die out if players start thinking this game is dead and telling potential buyers not to invest because there are no servers... I think after the next alpha release... you should get some developers to focus on improving the multiplayer experience in some non-gameplay related ways by that i mean something like a master server list (i think that's the term i'm looking for)... so when we start the game, we get a list of all running servers, and a tab with server's we've favourited or previously visited... This will promote people running servers, It will provide an easier way for players to find online servers that have active players (if you let us see the number of players online... which would really be a must). Being easier to find, makes it easier to justify spending a little money on a dedicated server. I would also suggest running a few servers yourselves. Contact some reasonably priced game server hosts and enquire about their service hosting your game (ties in with getting players to run their own servers 24/7... If it's as easy as click, pay, play.... you don't need to mess around with FTP to upload the relevant files etc). At the very least, if you guys can get your own servers running 24/7, your players can start being MUCH more active... which will ultimatley speed up your development process.... More active players means more chance of finding bugs (you probably already knew that) Moving away from the multiplayer aspect a little.... You NEED to keep your players interested... they need to believe this game is still being developed.... realistically, they arent going to check this website daily .... I've only had the game a day... so i dunno if you guys have an updater distributed with the game... But i'd recommend some way to make players know there's an update when they run the game, and then, you can try to push out weekly, or monthly updates (even if they are hotfixes or tiny patches that fixes one bug a week)... this will keep your players interested, they will be looking forward to the next update to see what you have fixed or added. I hope you'll seriously consider these tips... You NEED to make this game's player base more active.... at this moment in time, i wouldn't recommend buying the game to my friends because it is clearly designed for multiplayer, but there are too few players actually playing.
on a non-critical note... i LOVE the concept and hope i get the chance to play this game as part of a community soon :D"

Great job! One tiny complaint. Jumping is terrible. Trying to go up on anything with less than two or three spaces before the next jump means almost having to stop completely to avoid sticking to the next level. Then if you do get hung up you have to just stop completely and jump straight up without moving to avoid sticking again. I don't remember this being an issue in previous versions although I understand that in the first ones it was too easy to just climb walls (although I kind of enjoyed it) ;). Also, I'm not sure if it's already in the game or not but there really needs to be an option to turn objects like ramps/workstations.

It makes the game feel a little clunky and having the option to turn it off would be quite nice for snappier building/movement. ""Toggle Crosshair""
Building would be much easier if we were able to have some sort of crosshair or better indication where we would be placing blocks. Right now it is sort of hit or miss and feels sluggish especially with mouse smoothing enabled, but adding a better block placement indicator would be a nice quality of life update.

Eco's music system is undergoing huge improvements as we head towards Alpha 5. I understand that having only one static track can be really grating to hear repetitively. The new music system lays the groundwork for adaptive scoring, which will be the basis for all new tracks added to the game. Stay tuned to hear the new cues, coming in the next updates."

ideas-feedback,Rights trading system | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/801/rights-trading-system,762,1,1,MykeMichail,"So currently we have a system of restrictions based upon enacted laws, such as ""Each player may not kill more than X elk per day"". My suggestion is to allow players to trade a particular right that they have to another player. For example, if the law states that a player may not kill more than 2 Elk per day, and I don't have the hunting skill, then I'm never actually going to use that right at all. Furthermore if my hunting skill is too low, I will not have as much to gain from exercising that right than a player who has a high hunting skill. A simple work around would be for me, as a non-hunter or low skilled hunter, to sell, trade or give my right to kill 2 elk away to someone who can make better use of it. Perhaps this would need paper or some other form of transfer which basically states: ""I AParticularPlayer hereby grant AnotherParticularPlayer my right to kill 2 elk per day, for the next X days."" Those rights can be traded for another item or simply given away for free. The same could be applied to any other right, for example, the right to produce tailings. I could for example sell my right to produce tailings to someone who will get a much more benefit from producing them than I would. Essentially, it's a form of emissions trading scheme."

Part of the problem is that skillbooks are way too cheap to make, but the bigger issue is that trading doesn't work nicely. It was a cool idea to make it so there's no official currency, but it doesn't work.  Bartering is an annoying game of trying to guess what other people might have at their disposal to trade for your goods.  So, you have to set up multiple different copies of each trade deal with different prices in the hopes that someone happens to have the right stuff and also wants your item.  It's even worse when you're trying to set up buy orders.  There's a good reason proper currencies were set up IRL. As a buyer, you have to travel all over the world to each store to try to find what you're looking for.  In that time you could have just researched, trained, harvested, and built it yourself. The end result is that because it's such a nuisance, nobody uses the stores.   Instead, a small group of friends gets together and just shares all their recipes, gets way ahead, and leaves everyone else so far in the dust that they can't contribute anything to the world."

It does look like actually currency arrives later in the game, but one could still use a currency for valuation before that.  For example I set up a store and I assign values to all the items that I am interested in buying and selling, and then designate what I'll actually buy and sell.  So someone could come to my store to buy wood and pay in meat, stone, or sand without having to set up all those trades.  Then when physical currency is invented, people can just pay in hard currency instead of materials. I've seen this sort of mentioned before, but when setting up your store it would be super helpful have a list of what other stores offer, their valuations, and their physical location in relation to you.  Also, it would be helpful to set prices relative to the global average.  If you are selling raw materials in the middle of town, you might sell for average+10%.  If you are selling the boonies, they might go for average-10%.  One could get on with work instead always watching market prices."

Nonetheless, it creates a very unpleasant gameplay experience for anyone who isn't part of the clique. Goertz - Those are some great ideas!  I was stumped trying to think of alternatives to physical currency and I think you hit the nail on the head.  That way, the store can automatically do all the tedious legwork.  Calculating average prices could be tricky with the small sample sizes you'd see on most servers, though.  Even without that capability, setting your own personal relative values and seeing the contents of all stores in one list would both be phenomenal."

Trading scrolls is by far the worst aspect of the current stores.  Currently, if someone who researched something doesn't bother to make scrolls and put them up for sale, you have little choice but to research it yourself. Perhaps one option would be that the research table itself could act like a specialty store just for skills.  Prior to beginning a research project, the researcher must set a value and list of items they'd accept as payment (like you suggested for stores).  Then, any player can walk up to the research table and buy the skill.  And it would also show you where else in the world you can buy every skill (if anywhere)."

At the moment our community is pretty good and void of griefers for the most part, but eventually down the road when territory and resource disputes start popping up.  I can see this as being used as a situational devastating hit. Second at the moment people can go into your workshops and use up your fuel to do whatever they need to use it for.  That can get annoying especially if people know they are taking up your fuel on purpose. So having a toggle to prevent this would be an easy fix.  You would still have the option of having public workshops which is a direction I see the game is going with.  But also add an another layer of protection for players' property. As an added note: You could also do this the other way around, have workshops normally set as private and have a public toggle."

my logging yield is at lvl 3 so if i collect 5 logs it becomes 8, meaning i can carry 8 logs at once (least one would assume) yet if i get logs from an object like a cart or chest i can only carry 5 max would be neat if there was a skill that affected how much weight you can carry at once  or if each yield skill increased your carry limit for that item"

Only read the news and descriptions. And it of course feels an awesome idea.
Just imagine: such a social experiment!
But when I got to the description of perspectives of law enforcement I wondered...
Of course, punishment is the most popular mode of control of other people's behavior, but it's not the only one! There's reinforcement also! The designers of the game (understandably) make the same mistake our governments and parents and teachers and trainers make! Why not try another way, at least in the game?!
If you want to reduce chopping wood, reinforce (reward) other activities, incompatible with woodcutting, and reduce reinforcement of woodcutting.
Even more: why not provide ingame tools for BOTH modes of control?..
Of course this needs further elaboration.
My personal opinion: the designers of the game SHOULD read B.F. Skinner's ""Contingencies of reinforcement"". Google it, it's worth it."

I imagine it places design limitations on the UI elements and animation also and that's something I know a bit more about as a designer, animator and occasional product designer. Any plans to freshen it up? There's so much hyperreality and simulation in this Sim already my judgement is that it's unnecessary to gain the human touch, that's already there in spades. And I think it presents limitations and an aesthetic that isn't on par with the where the 3D mesh rendering and animation is heading."

I have been playing it a bit now. I know that consuming different foods has a major effect on how we earn skills. I was interested in playing this game as a vegan. So far everything has gone ok with consuming just berries. I don't know at this point where the game is going so it doesn't feel right to comment but... Seeing as this is a game where the player has an effect on the environment I was a bit disappointed to discover that it's a bit more difficult to play in the manner that I was hoping to play. I don't know how informed you all are on the environment and how transportation and diet also has a huge impact on the world around us.
It's a bit of a hot topic in the vegan world right now. With the documentary Cowspiracy coming out, our dietary impact is on the minds of a lot of people. I don't know how intricate and detailed the game is going to get or if it's basically just going to be as described and what I have experienced so far. I was just sharing my thoughts."

I left it on day 3, and came back to it on day 23. Every tree cut down is still a stump, the symptoms of I guess ""pollution"" are still there and nothing has grown to take it's place.  In the real world, if you take from the system, then give it time to rest, the land will heal. If there is no one active in the world something should happen to the natural systems proportional to the rate of the game. (which naturally means that if 20 days pass in a game where the world ends on 30 in one night there should be something happening here, but maybe not if time can be adjusted to run slower) Animals also seem to by dying near where I had to cut down trees (a total of 9) to build the house that... can't be finished... and I can't do anything with the animal. No option to eat, no way to get another tool, no nothing.  I'm sure there is a way to do all of that at this stage, but the point of bringing it up is that it's not obvious. I don't see in game help options, or a list of controls on the website even, and that's also something that should be fixed."

(and as a side note, building on ledges is much more difficult here than it is in Minecraft. I had to build a mini ledge and then one higher and higher still removing the old bridges before finally getting it right since I can't just look over the edge and add it that way)  It is nice how you can see the curvature of the Earth though! and in regards to farm land, shouldn't the lot eventually ""reclaim"" if not in use? like weeds or such? or at least if no crops are growing there grass returns? Here's a plot of farmland where I planted ""bunchgrass seeds"" just to get rid of it (since it harvests itself endlessly while trying to harvest crops next to it) and it eventually grew here and then deleted itself leaving bare land.

ideas-feedback,First Play Notes | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/540/first-play-notes,1452,2,1,zztong,"I downloaded 0.3 client and server today and played for a couple of hours just to see how things are going. This was my first experience with the game. Knowing the game is still very early in development, and (as a former software engineer), I decided to keep an informal journal, which I've pasted in below in hopes that it might help the cause in some way shape or form. It is not intended to be critical of the game, but when I got stumped, I just said what I was feeling. Eco First Impressions (version 0.3, release 13 or 14?) I was following this quickstart guide... https://www.reddit.com/r/EcoGlobalSurvival/comments/3u1nzt/eco_quickstart_guide/ I don't mind the TAB thing to change modes. Its like ""Life is Feudal."" I admit the first time I encountered TAB to change modes it was a bit odd, but not terrible. It is odd not having a target, or plus sign in the middle of the screen to show me what I'm aiming at. I'd like to have the option of turning one on as it can be awkward to know how to adjust the aim of the axe to hit what I want to hit. Sure, I get a green highlight when I do aim at it, but it isn't always clear which way to move the mouse to get the green highlight to show.
I chased a deer until it got stuck on some tall grass and then just ran in place. I chased a rabbit until it got stuck on a change in elevation. This just seems like work in progress, so no biggie. I found a short river that was flowing downhill in both directions and into the same crevace. Again, this seems like work in progress. (Or perhaps there was a natural spring under there?) Building the Workshop was awkward. At first it never occurred to me to place blocks and the jump on them to be able to place the higher blocks. You'd think after all of the Minecraft playing that I've done it would have been obvious. The appearance of the logs when placed was throwing me off. By this, I mean the roof/ceiling didn't look right. Also, it wasn't obvious that I had to match the white outlined cube. The cube didn't look like a building, so I assumed it was just defining the work space, or something. Its annoying that the mouse is captured by the game and cannot leave the window when you're in the UI mode. I've got two monitors and I almost always have something else going on when I play games, even if its just email. I often have some kind of document open so I can take notes. I cannot seem to remove stumps. I cannot seem to target stumps. Do I need some other tool? I've just got an axe at the moment. The quickstart wanted me to build a Scythe. I brought up the Work Bench, found the Scythe option, had 15 logs available in quickbar slot 2, and could not get it to make a Scythe. It said ""1m"" whatever that means. (1 minute?) ""1m < 1 > Order."" Ah, the < and > are buttons. Okay so 2 takes 2 minutes? Is that right? The order button never does anything. Oh, mousing over the icon just above the Order button it says ""Rough Cut Lumber"" and it says ""B (O)"". B? O? Windmill says 25, so maybe that's a 3 and a 0. The font is a small problem for me. If I put my face close to the monitor, Shovel says 3, but Scythe still looks like a B. The font is just a touch too small. Okay, so I must need to make Rough Cut Lumber somehow. Ah! Rough Cut Lumber is also on the Recipes list. I scrolled right past it before looking for the Scythe. The order button is green. Better. It says 1 (15) by the icon for logs. I know I have 15 in inventory. I'm guessing I'll get 1 unit of Rough Cut Lumber. I click Order, 1 second later I have 14 logs. Where's the lumber? Its not in inventory. Hmm, is this a bug. Oh wait, there were messages on the screen behind the work bench and inventory windows, but I did't get to them in time and they disappeared. I have no idea what they said. I guess I'll make more lumber. ""Work order created... return to the Work Bench..."" Huh? Okay, I guess I'll close the work bench and click on it again. Another window called ""Your items"" pops up and it has 4 lumber in it. As big as the Work Bench window is, it might as well take up the whole screen and include ""Your Items"" and ""Back Pack"" in it. That or let me move the work bench window over to my other monitor. Its weird to have to leave the workbench and then return to it. I mean that probably makes sense if you're going to wait several minutes for something as you'll probably wander around in that time, though you might equally just AFK and come back. In fact, when making the Scythe, I went AFK for 30 secs and typed more in these notes. The work bench was open the entire time in game. The ""i"" key doesn't seem to open my backpack. Maybe there just isn't a key for that. I play with the skill stuff like the quickstart says, but I don't manage to figure it out. I appear to have a skill point. No idea how to spend it. I decide to revisit it later and look around, instead.
I harvest huckleberries. Can I eat those, or are they poisonous? I ate three of them for 60 calories and I hope I don't perish from eating something poisonous. As I look around, there's more plants, but not a lot of them. I wonder if I should perhaps plant some and start a garden, else I'll have to run all over creation to find more and I'm burning calories seemingly fast. Within site there are 4 deer, 5 rabits, 4 birds. I start harvesting plants to see what they are. Bunchgrass Seed? Can I eat that? Camas Bulb? No idea. I decide to make more tools. Hmm, the ""Your Items"" window is open from the beginning this time, and the lumber pops right up in there. Why didn't this happen the first time? No idea.
When trying to figure out what to make next, I notice there are skill books. The farming skill book wants Camus Bulbs and Huckleberries. Ah, well okay then. I decide to make a shovel and see if I can use it to make steps down a cliff I'm next to. Then I can try to find the stuff for this book. I saw a rabbit either jump or fall off a cliff. I don't see him down there. I wonder if he lived. Too much grass seed. How do I drop some? Attempting to drag it out of my inventory to the ground didn't work. No idea. F1, no help. ESC to find an options menu and some key bindings... nope. Why do some huckleberry plants give me grass seed, instead. Are they not huckleberry plants? I find another huckleberry plant and it does give me huckleberries. I'm confused. Maybe its a bug, or maybe I'm missing something. A wolf/dog runs at me, no away, at me, away, at me. Is this thing dangerous? I ready the axe. It eventually runs away. As I harvest stuff, my quickbar fills, so I move things to my backpack. As I harvest more stuff I notice that rather than continue to stack up in my backpack, it instead starts a new stack on the quickbar. Why? I run out of time. The game is at Day 5 and I'm at 1,655 kCal. I have 2 skill points and I think I need a book to use them, but I'm not sure."

ideas-feedback,Batteries | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/539/batteries,767,1,1,Elliander,"Since this game is going to have vehicles and such, what about a resource that can store energy to be used for work? It could be a chemical battery that needs crafting, but I think it would be more fun if it was a crystal battery that is mined and has value. Otherwise we will need a chemistry skill tree. Although the question of how much energy it should store and needing to recharge comes up. Iron in turn can form power lines, but why not have wireless charging? Lay the wires in the road itself and it can charge nearby objects. Like what Tesla did with light bulbs. Cars could be powered by a current in the road which itself is powered by public utilities, increasing the need for cooperation. The cars could go off a powered road, but without being in range of a current the battery would deplete. If instead of cars being single objects, but functional parts, we could use the same machines for other purposes. Instead of the wheels pushing a car forward, they could be attached to boards to push water upstream as a kind of resource conveyor belt for distribution of goods. Maybe I could have a boat road. Programmable tech like they have in Minecraft would also be nice."
ideas-feedback,Building and gardening under ground and under ocean | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/537/building-and-gardening-under-ground-and-under-ocean,1147,1,1,Elliander,"I really like that there is no suffocation mechanic and was able to build a functional group of buildings several blocks under the ocean. It was a bit of a challenge setting up up to allow me in and out without flooding it, but it worked. What I didn't like was that I couldn't grow anything down there even though the area lights up with day light during the day through the hole in the ceiling.  It would be nice if I could at least set up artificial lighting to grow plants and even trees and even translocate animals under ground or in clear domes at the bottom of the ocean. (maybe glass blocks could be a crafting item that could form a dome if put together a certain way) If we could build tidal energy or even geothermal energy production systems it would be possible to limit environmental impact by building in domed cities. Of course, if that is possible, there would probably be a need to expand on the ocean importance. Algae, for example, could have a bloom cycle near farmland that uses nitrogen fertilizer taken from animal husbandry (but maybe farmland grows faster near the water to create a conflicting interest) and setting up a farm upstream can cause fish to die out all along. That could in turn conflict with the interests of players who do fishing. Maybe also allow players to set up fish farms by closing off sections of ocean, but if the waters are connected it could foul up the nearby water. Building under the ocean would therefore mean competition for space, and farming can still leach into the surrounding waters causing harm. Maybe building underground could provide a viable alternative to stopping the meteorite. Instead of forcing players to push towards high tech, maybe allow them to try and weather the storm so the world doesn't end, it just turns into a harsh winter that eventually gets better. This could create incentive for going under ground and pushing for renewable energies like geothermal power, but could create a conflict of interest as some players will want to form an underground commune while other players will try to stop it. If geothermal power tech could also allow someone to crack the core (beneath the bedrock) it could be a route to a doomsday weapon as well, maybe even creating a kind of Lex Luther scenario as one faction of players try to doom another faction while at the same time wanting to plan to restore the world after. Adding layers of social dynamics would make for some interesting outcomes."

I can't even add something to the exterior. It says ""You are not authorized to build here"" (even though I am the owner, and I am the only one in the world) so I tried changing it to public and I still not not change anything.  This could be serious in the case of a player not building any openings (is there even a game mechanic to get unstuck? or is the player condemned to sit in their hovel until the world ends?), or as simple as not being able to add a door to the existing deed. My house has 4 doors. Each one must have it's own deed in addition to the deed of the house. There's no way to add it when it is built, and no way to append it to the deed of the house."

Unfortunately, the delay is unsuitable for small friends-and-family servers.  Even if everyone on the server unanimously approves a law, they still have to wait 24 hours. It seems to me that once a law has enough yes votes to pass, it should pass.  For example, if there are 5 people on a given server, 3 vote yes, and one of them votes no, it should pass immediately.

These machines can produce interlocking bricks like legos which can in turn have molds customized. They are usually dry stacked without rebar, with grout placed down the ""cores"" of the bricks along with steel rebar reinforcement. Well, what if we had something like that? It could require a curing process, so still have the potential for environmental damage (or sun baking which takes longer) but then players can customize a lego type building system. It could be as simple as drawing shapes on a mold piece, which translates to how the block is made and how it matches up with other inlocking blocks."
ideas-feedback,Keep deed from disappearing when house deselected | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/525/keep-deed-from-disappearing-when-house-deselected,591,1,1,Elliander,"I created a solo server to get a feel for things and one of the first things I tried doing was building the house. While trying to get a feel for everything I somehow deselected building mode which caused the deed to disappear, but left raw materials in place. On the one hand, it's nice to be able to change the requested deed area if I need to. On the other hand, it seems very easy to abuse since anyone could swoop in and ""claim"" it and take all the raw materials away. I also noticed on more than a few occasions that while building it would deselect the deed and I wouldn't notice, but I was still building. The obvious solution is for the deeds to remain good for the full duration unless explicitly cancelled, for the game to notify the player if the claim has expired, and for the  player to have an option to request a change to the boundaries - perhaps by ""dragging"" the boundary. ""Blueprint Deselected"" is the message I get now when I try to select the logs with the scroll mouse when the deed disappears >.< So I can only finish building with it free to claim. "
ideas-feedback,[Suggestion] Weather/Seasons/Tides | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/524/suggestion-weather-seasons-tides,3145,6,1,PapiChue,"Apologies if this has already been suggested... But I think some sort of weather system would be great for this game. Cloudy and sunny days, clouds would hurt crop growth after a while and reduce temperature. Droughts can occur and hinder crop growth and die if not watered. Clouds build or blow in and rain storms form that saturate the ground and help crops grow, but too much would cause surrounding waters to rise and wash away crops, and even buildings or parts of buildings. Thunderstorms could form creating high winds that down trees and damage building's, rip up the roof or windows, knock out power, and blow objects around. Lightning could strike and burn buildings or forests down. Flooding usually occurs in some shape or form but depends on the intensity of the storm. Buildings on the coast could experience damaging waves that potentially wash away buildings into the oceans, which perhaps could help wildlife by allowing a reef to form upon the sunken ruins. Hurricanes are essentially more extreme and longer lasting thunderstorms.
Tornadoes could occur and cause extremely powerful but isolated wind damage. These storms could start relatively mild but pollution and global warming would intensify them and increase the frequency of intense storms. Seasons could occur and change every x amount of time. Summer is hotter, creates more thunderstorms but rains less overall and is more humid. Hurricanes occur during summer. During fall the leaves on the trees change color and fall, creating potential fertilizer as the leaves decay. During winter snowstorms and extreme blizzards occur, freezing crops and water, dropping varying amounts of snow  that must be cleared for roads to function. Trees have no leaves during winter. During spring, everything begins to regrow and it rains often, flowers sprout and snowmelt can potentially cause flooding. Lastly, tides. Large bodies of water could experience high and low tides that are enhanced by storms. Low tides could create tide pools essential for the survival of many creatures. Feel free to change or add on my ideas...let me know what you think...thanks for reading :)"
ideas-feedback,[Suggestion] Weather/Seasons/Tides | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/524/suggestion-weather-seasons-tides,3145,6,2,H4CK3RD4WG,"I think this would be appropriate if variability in frequency and intensity of weather events could be clearly shown to be a result of land-use by players. For instance,  deforestation around rivers and coastal areas is well-known to contribute to more intense flooding events. I think we would have a hard time making more extreme weather events like hurricanes and tornadoes not seem arbitrary, especially since real scientists have basically no idea how human activity influences these events. This isn't to say hurricanes and tornadoes don't exist, but maybe Eco should be more about helping players understand how real decisions affect ecosystems. I really like the idea of incorporating flooding into the agricultural system, since this is a main source of nutrient pollution in modern industrial agriculture as well."
ideas-feedback,[Suggestion] Weather/Seasons/Tides | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/524/suggestion-weather-seasons-tides,3145,6,3,PapiChue,"I was under the impression global warming was causing more intense hurricanes, my bad. But I do believe global warming has caused more precipitation to fall during storms, including in the winter, leading to bigger blizzards and rainstorms. (I could be wrong) So maybe pollution leads to an increase in the amount of precipitation during storms, so more flooding, more snow? Shorter winters, hotter summers with more wildfires and droughts, as in California, etc? Also I believe global warming is worsening storm surge from hurricanes, because of rising seas. And while hurricanes and tornadoes are arbitrary, I feel like they are important aspects of ecosystems around the world. (but thats just my opinion)"
ideas-feedback,[Suggestion] Weather/Seasons/Tides | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/524/suggestion-weather-seasons-tides,3145,6,4,H4CK3RD4WG,"I'd say you're right about all those things to some extent. What makes them so difficult to understand in the real world is that human impacts on frequency of hurricanes, severity of storms etc. are non-local. That is, a coal-burning steel mill in Pittsburgh or Shanghai might be contributing to longer wet seasons and more severe flooding in Bangladesh, which has a comparatively smaller impact on global greenhouse gas emissions. For a local environment like Eco, we'd have to be careful about saying how much pollution here affects weather patterns here, there... anywhere. Real scientists don't even know much about it--which would make it hard to put the problem in an educational context. Keep in mind Eco takes place in a Pacific Northwestern environment, so we would have a pretty definite range of weather events to deal with.
I still like what you are saying about flooding. While Bangladeshis can't control variability in precipitation between seasons, the way they manage land, distribute crops and build infrastructure has very immediate effects on the ecosystems and agricultural systems that can determine how serious a flood event is. This puts comprehension of ecosystem processes firmly back into the player's control and emphasizes building--which takes advantage of the voxel engine and the way it handles hydrology. If we could do this, then we could really motivate a weather system (with varying severity of rainstorms and everything you said) so that players are forced to plan for flood control as their society develops."

Some things I've noticed that can be improved is how they're leveled up. Currently with how it's set up you right click your skill and that's what you start leveling up. This makes leveling 1 skill far to easy in the game. I believe a better approach would be to give XP relative to the task you're doing. For example if I sit and chop wood all day then the XP will be put into that, not any other skill. Also if I understand correctly you get XP per hour while playing the game while on or offline (I could be wrong, but that's how I read it.). I believe players should be rewarded for actually playing the game and not going afk for X-hours and come back with 1-3 levels in a skill. I fell it'd be more rewarding to put time into leveling that skill then apposed to just sitting around."

Right now the way it is it feels like a server would have to be reset every week otherwise everyone would have everything. Also the skill multiplier is X per hour. It doesn't state whether you need to be online to get this. So at the moment you can be logged off and get X skill points an hour. I'm not sure what the cap you get from the other nutrients except for fat and sodium. seeing as both need to be at a .2 to be useful and the max skill multiplier you get is a .5 addition. Being able to keep both at around .2 you automatically get a 1 skill point per hour. I also currently have vitamins at 1.48 and that gives me a .61 skill point an hour. assuming that carbs and protein will give you the same skill points and not seeing that there will be a cap it could cause servers to push and end games faster. I do however like the idea of having to maintain your character even when you are offline. I think this is a very interesting idea and should be embraced. Just the way you get skills and how fast you can level the skill seems to fast paced atm.

Another good idea if you plan to keep them is to allow others to steal them if you plan on having pvp in the game as an element.

This implementation is superior to forcing all windows closed with tab in my opinion. There's nothing wrong with overlapping windows. I personally like the no crosshair aspect to the game.  Makes hunting feel more rewarding. I wouldn't mind scrolling through the hotbar with mouse wheel, though bet there could be a better functionality for the mouse wheel than that. Regarding server name, like point 1, unless it takes longer than seconds it's not worth building functionality that can be made redundant by copy and pasting from a notepad. The collision box should absolutely have some small degree of sliding, but making the player get caught on stuff can be really good too.  It gives value to a more open or intelligently designed building or area, rather than maximum efficiency cramped minimalistic wood cubes.  For this reason I think it should stay.

In case you're not just trolling:  Invert mouse is incredibly important to the people that need it.  Please provide data that shows it's not common; Among the games I play it certainly is. Actually, nevermind, please don't post data.  It doesn't matter if it's common.  Invert mouse is a really, really helpful feature for some people; it's got a high probability of being super easy to implement (at least compared to other features); and it won't hurt you a bit if it's added. And there certainly IS something wrong with windows that start overlapped -- you need to move the one on top somewhere else before you can use the one underneath.  The couple of seconds it takes you to move that top window multiplied by every time you use a workbench adds up to irritation, especially if there was enough screen to not need to overlap them. Personally,. I don't see how it is at all ""EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL"" to be able to  move with workbench windows open.  In game I have not needed that feature at all so far.  Instead I find myself annoyed that I must either navigate to a door without being able to see it (because there's an open workbench window blocking my view) or having to close the window manually, which is not really so much work, but it gets annoying the 100th time or if you're trying to hurry.

Regarding your second point, no - there's nothing wrong with windows that overlap.  The most useful or least intrusive windows should be on top of course, but having windows appearing overlapping with each other rather than shoved off the side of the screen is superior in my opinion.  Some people don't have large monitors.  Seeing as you want to cater to people who play with inverted mouse in alpha, certainly you'd want to cater to those with small monitors/play spaces hm? The click you'll save by having windows spread out is worth about as much as the mouse movement to get to a further away window.

If your argument against an invert mouse feature only applies to the alpha version as you hint, then I certainly agree with you that it's not as pressing a concern as other things.  People playing during alpha are probably motivated enough to fight through the disorientation of always looking up when they mean to look down for a while.  My shocked reaction was because I thought you were arguing to never implement it.  Reading back, I see that I overlooked OP's emphasis on wanting these features in next alpha. I also agree that of course there is nothing inherently wrong with windows overlapping.  I hope I didn't seem to suggest that the user not be allowed to overlap windows if they want!  I am only trying to say that when windows first pop up, they shouldn't start with important controls obscured if at all possible.  After that, the user should be able to move the window whereever they like and the game should remember where they put it the next time it pops up."

The one thing that is very interesting to me is that apparently an invert y-axis toggle (for mouse looking) is considered ""abnormal"" or ""unnecessary"" by quite some folks. I have been playing games since MS-DOS (a lot), and literally every one I played that employed the mouse for looking around included an ""invert mouse"" setting. Even if there are hardly any settings, there is always an ""invert mouse"" setting. No exceptions. In my opinion, it is the most crucial setting of all settings. I am amazed that it is even a discussion point. Imagine that every time you want to look up, you look down, and visa versa. Now imagine there is no setting to fix this mind blowing behavior. Welcome to the world of 50% of all gamers. It is like denying that left handed people exist (who make up 50% of humanity). All the other features I mentioned are secondary and merely my opinion. Invert mouse is not an opinion, not even a discussion, it is an essential part of the controls. In my opinion. I'd love to be proven wrong though. Find me one game that uses the mouse to look around that does not provide an invert mouse setting."

I do remember the first time I played Quake, and first encountered mouse-forward == look up.  The moment I stopped vomiting I found the invert mouse setting and engaged it.  And until last year did so in every other first person game I played.  I am forgetting at the moment what early-access game it was last year that didn't have invert-y and finally caused me to switch, but I remember it was quite uncomfortable to reprogram my subconscious and took a long time.  And thinking of mouse-forward as up still sounds weird to me even though I am now programmed to do it and would now struggle with the setting I used to need. I don't have data on how many people like regular vs. inverted-y.  Or if it's quite as hard for them to switch as it was for me.  But for an educational game that seems likely to be complex (eventually), I would encourage Eco's developers to at least make first person navigation as intuitive as possible to as wide an audience of players as possible before general availability.  An invert-y option doesn't seem like a big ask (but then I don't know much about Unity, so it might well be).  For anyone unsympathetic to the problem, I would encourage them to try playing their favorite first-person game with mouse inverted and see how long it takes to become comfortable."

Probably, to a degree.  It's silly to think that majority of players use an inverted mouse for mouse purposes.  Go to every computer in a computer store - all the computers there are going to mouse up when you push forward, and mouse down when you pull back.  Look at any non-flight game out there.  By default, you're going to look up when you push forward, and down when you pull back.  Consider that the term 'inverted mouse' contains the word 'inverted' which means 'backwards vertical axis'. Considering the camera movement in a first person, give the plane that the mouse is on the shortest rotation possible to become the same plane that the monitor is on.  Pushing the mouse down at this point brings vision down.  Pushing it up brings vision up.  This perfectly logical. Where inverted mouse (both X and Y)  is used most today is typically when the origin of the perspective is not in the same point as the fulcrum of its pivot - such as a third person camera, or the nose of a space ship. @zupahfly said: And in the same amount of time you spent typing this reply, you could have downloaded AHK and pasted the code in."

I understand that people have preference for inverted y-axis.
I never imagine playing inverted y axis cause my background there was no console.
I realized that people who played console a lot, usually prefer inverted-y because they think they are control stick(or their head is head of control stick.)
However, because I was used to mouse movements and look-up, I can't player inverted-y even in console.
I will check unity have easy setting for that and try to give option for near future.

I think it'd be much more clear and convenient if it opened onto a large enough window for you to see all of the storage slots at once, like the backpack does (of course, there may be future upgrades to storehouses that allow them to gain too large a capacity to conveniently fit on the screen, but you can make the larger window still capable of scrolling if such a case comes up). Second, I quite like the one or two bits of music currently in the game, but they come up much too rarely! It's just long periods of silent, suddenly and seemingly-randomly broken by a brief round of music. I'm not sure if this is a bug, but if it's intentional, I for one would much prefer if the music was just on continuously (obviously with an option added to toggle the music once the game reaches the stage where it actually has an options menu :) )."

If you're serious about the game and actually want it to be successful, your first step would be lowering the price. No reason somebody should pay full price for a game that is in its alpha stage, especially when there are 100's of other games that are far more complete and far better looking, that people could & would rather spend their money on..  You're pricing yourself out of the market. Anyways, thought the game looked cool, wanted to support it, but for it's price, i'm going to buy Squad, a game that was fully released today, runs on unreal engine, 50v50 combat, 5 kilometer map etc. etc. and you'll never guess how much they're charging.... $40....

The issue is that developing a game cost money .. loots of it , they need to pay rent, software license ( those are really expensive ! ), rent for server ( also quit expensive ) developers want to get payed ( and good developer are also very expensive ) so lets break down there founding . they have 500k from a found + 200 k from kickstarter . game is set to be done in 2017. so lets devide 700k by those 2 years thats only ruffly 29000 dollars a month they have . so lets say they have around 7 employ's all on them get around 2,5k - 3k .. lets say 3k just to have a good margin thats monthly around 21000 already . + rent of the office .. naaa around 5000 a month and so on .. i really dont think i need to continue with my theoretical math here .. its almost nothing left. and i doubt this game will sell as weel as like minecraft did with its 10 million copies. So for now the initial price needs to be high to support the cost, and well its not a aaa game but you should see it more as to help founding the game to even have more founding to develop the game. I personally backed them with almost 200 $ at kickstarter because i like the concept and i know development is costly. and they cant sit with 0 $ left after the game is done .. because they need more money after the release in 2017 to both maintain ,extent and create a new game where they can life from. i hope i managed to give you some insight why possibly the price is high and hope you see why it is that high .. for now it is .. btw .. its not even close to the price other earlier games have & had .. like elite dangerous with 300$ and no goodies at all"

Though who knows as they could be following the same approach as most indies are as in they price the game low at first due to their potential customers taking a risk with backing/buying into a game in an early state of completion but also as an reward for those believing in them early on e.g. Steam Early-Access BUT than they start to scale the price up as the game progresses. Honestly I'd say it would be ill advised to price the Beta at say $60+ USD and I'd suggest the developers scale the price down when they hit Steam in beta to help gain a much larger tester base of consumers for the game. The downside with this is that current owners of Eco MAY be slightly put off that they paid $35-$40 on the game in Alpha and it is now $25-$20 on Steam BUT I feel those customers would be an acceptable minority and pricing the game in such a way benefit it and the community greatly. Perhaps @JohnK can touch on this subject further but I'd assume it's too early to tell what their future pricing roadmap may be, not to mention if they (the developers) are even willing disclose their plans on that matter to us, the community/consumers to begin with for various reasons."

Thus, you're not actually paying for an Alpha Quality game, you're paying for the full quality game a few years in advance, and getting the benefit early access as a result of paying in advance. This is clearly evidenced by the fact getting alpha access costs more, not less than, beta access, and how the ""developer pack"" costs substantially more than the four-pack Because you're not just paying for a game that's already been developed.

We intentionally want to keep the playerbase small and the barrier to entry high, so that its a group of dedicated players who want to help us develop the game with bug reports, feedback, and contributions. The game is not even half done, it's not ready for a wide release yet, so while we could make a lot more money in the short term by lowering our prices, we would hamstring our actual release down the line, when the game is really ready  (you only get one launch, as they say).  That's the same reason we're not on Steam Early Access yet. So it's pretty likely we'll lower our prices, in a year or more after the game is a lot closer to release.

I just read through a lot of the bugs reported and didn't miss anything I came across yet. So I decided to simply give some feedback on how I feel about the gameplay. I'm sure that some of this is going to be changed anyways and is already kept in mind but this is alpha testing so holding back my feedback will definetly help less then being redundant.

Building in the game feels more like creative mode and not really survival mode.  I hope building will take more work (clicks) in the future.  There is nothing significant about constructing the building itself (unless avoiding build block bugs is considered) - all the significance is in the acquisition of the materials used in the construction.  Personally I'd like to see building the building involve some sweat, at least as much as acquiring the materials. I think this would only reinforce the intended gameplay, regarding the sharing of buildings and what not. Regarding orientation, I think the ability to see coordinates is more than enough for alpha.  I hope that these coordinates are removed after alpha - working based on landmarks/getting lost is a really powerful moving element to a game and will absolutely enhance the experience.

I love your post, it reflects some interesting points. I too am going to have to agree with @Psycho-Romeo on #1 but each is to their own and there will always be difference in opinion here. I personally quite enjoy the slightly more complicated aspect of it and being able to build block by block can allow for more freedom in design. Some of the points you touched on, I will add - are being developed already I believe. 'Don't quote me' but the water physics were already touched upon by the Devs pointing out that nice flowing water would be awesome but it is difficult for programmers to implement without the result causing other bugs that can end up flooding the world in never-ending flowing water. Planting trees is a feature in the game - or at least, it will be. I can't say for sure but it's definitely in the works. The item 'Cedar Seed' is already embedded in the game SPOILER TAG: (This feature is highlighted when you unlock the trading post and can view all items currently available to trade - whether you hold them or not, this is possibly a bug but none the less, Cedar Seed exists within this item pool and therefore is likely to either already be present in the game (or at least exist for future development within it) - although, I cannot prove it as I personally have never obtained one as of yet). If you look at the Trello board on the development forum - you will see that the in-game server list is already in development and we should expect to see something like what you described in Eco's future. Your ideas regarding the printing press and the idea of simulating societies - I love the printing press idea, I hate the simulating societies idea (but again this is just my opinion). I can't help feel that in a game that was about simulating societies, it would suddenly become quite competitive and change the pace of what Eco is all about. Furthermore, if bonuses were granted on ranks - no doubt people would suddenly flood to servers that were doing well just simply because they wanted to 'share the wealth' and the game would lose the relaxing feel it has (regardless of the incoming meteor and other pressure-time-related features (that I do love, just to point out)). The game lacking this competitive nature is something I enjoy because it gives you free-time to think about the problem with your planet, without having to worry about glory and reward systems - which is inevitably what the game would begin to develop into should they have taken that route.

A creative building is only for aesthetics and unless you're going for a minimalist approach, it will probably take more resources than is necessary so it's actually a disincentive for anyone to deviate from the bare minimum space box house. I really dig your idea for comparing servers to one another but that's because I'm competitive even in the most intended to be casual environments. The only problem would be the ""share the wealth"" problem mentioned by Linkman above."
ideas-feedback,Early Game Feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/339/early-game-feedback,5383,11,6,DNLinkman,"@Dethpickle Perhaps, and maybe it's too early to say - but if you have read the Dev Blog, there is a section regarding the direction the Artist wants to head towards (The blog was only released today, it might be in your inbox on your email). The direction the Artist wishes to head in (just ideas at the moment - nothing has been confirmed) is to allow each block to have 9 subsections which you can potentially chip with a tool (for example, axe to wood or pickaxe to stone) and create interesting variations of blocks. This is the very kind of creative design I was hinting towards in my response to Konrad and is the very kind of thing I would love to see implemented in the game. Yes, it's aesthetic - however, if you're carving blocks you have simply already used - then perhaps really it wouldn't take more resources but the same amount. It would be even cooler if the chippings you take off the wood could allow you to use that material in some other way - meaning considering the aesthetics of your house could actually pay off! It's only early talk and ideas at the moment though."

I really would love a different approach to building. This game has so many cool things going for it and I think a break away from the typical place a block at a time minecraft style could really set this game apart in regards to building. Thank you for confirming and promising that will be in the game! I jest, but surrsly, you should definitely push for some innovation on the method of building things."

ideas-feedback,Early Game Feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/339/early-game-feedback,5383,11,10,Konrad,"Hey All, thank you for the fruitful discussion!@DNLinkman regarding the topic of ""simulating societies"" What I meant was that whatever happens, when people play Eco together they develop a kind of society and they have to - as a society or as individuals - decide how they want to deal with resources and pollution and so on.
I get that ranking servers will make people do what ""gives a lot of credit"" - but thats not what I intended at all. For me what is most interesting about Eco (my personal opinion) is that it makes you reflect the way we deal with our actual planet. Just a simple example: in Eco the first law that is proposed usually has something to do with deforestation because it can quickly kill the game when a lot of people just exploit without thinking. However in real life forests are owned by corporations and ...you get the idea. I would love to see if it would be possible to use dynamics/laws that are created in Eco to link them to real life problems. But you are absolutely right: if there was a server rating system that informs about pollution ratio, wealth and so on people will most likely chose the ""most succesful server"". How is it intended: when destruction of planet by meteor or anything else you come up with is avoided - can a server theoretically run ""forever""?
My thought is: if a game ends at some point there would be a way of analyzing its results and what laws effected what actions/outcome  ...
Take care! :)"
ideas-feedback,Early Game Feedback | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/339/early-game-feedback,5383,11,11,DNLinkman,"@Konrad - I think I understand. If you mean, a general comparison that doesn't highlight any server in particular but just compiles data in overall statistics from different servers to analyse what kind of laws had what effects over different servers - then yes, I certainly agree that would be interesting statistical data.. provided, the developers kept the laws open as they are now (otherwise, again you'd find that sweeping generalistic, oh we can see this works so now every server seems to have this law proposed first). Certainly, I'll admit the data would prove intriguing to find out what works and what doesn't - however, such data should be taken in small samples and not frequently to avoid trends raising among servers in what is successful. @Airis-Damon - I think this has been fed back before, I'm sure I saw somewhere it was in development. I don't know whether it was a feedback or something a Dev actually said though so I dunno but I could imagine that corpses add additional data to servers that is a bit of a waste of memory.. so I could imagine it's something that will be fixed soon."

I think for 8, that it might be an intentional part of the game design that workshops, even workshops you created, can get clogged up with other people's orders if you leave them publicly accessible, especially if you don't charge any usage fee."
ideas-feedback,[Suggestion] A few longer-term suggestions | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/338/suggestion-a-few-longer-term-suggestions,925,1,1,Cubic John,"These aren't immediate priorities, but a few things I think would improve the game if they could be added sometime before final release. First, I think it would be extremely helpful to have some sort of auto-construct or construct-from-template ability that creates the bare essentials of a particular building type all at once if you have sufficient materials in your inventory. This could take a few minutes if construction time is meant to be a significant factor, but I personally find putting a building together block-by-block to be pretty annoying, especially with it kind of tricky to move around on top of walls right now with the lack of a Minecraft-style alternate movement mode that keeps you from falling off of ledges. People could make modifications to this base template before finalizing construction if they want to change anything, but this would help people who just want the no-nonsense mechanical benefits of a building accomplished with as little time and headache as possible, especially if they're confused by how exactly the game is assessing building requirements. There would still be benefits to players who understand the building system well enough to not rely on these templates, as they'd be able to save on building materials in certain cases with clever designs, or possibly achieve some other gains in functionality. Second, I kind of just thought of this one while writing the above, but the addition of a minecraft-style alternate movement mode (crouching, slow-walking, whatever) that keeps you from falling off of ledges would make navigating around, especially while you're building, a lot easier. Third, right now there's no reason (as far as I know) to build a building larger than the bare minimum, and it could also be annoying to have to build a whole new building just to get another workstation/chest/whatever. So I'd love to eventually see the ability to build extra-large buildings, where if you make a building sufficiently larger than normal it will contain two or even more workstations instead of just one. It would be a matter of game design and balance whether such supersized buildings would require more or fewer building materials per workstation produced than building individual minimum-sized buildings. Fourth and finally, and this is the one I'm least certain would be a good fit for the game (although I personally do think it would be), whenever I see animal corpses out in the wild dead of natural causes (I'm never sure whether of wolf attack or starvation), I feel like I should be able to scavenge some meat off of those carcasses. I kept trying to do so, in fact, until I finally crafted a bow and learned that the meat just materializes in your inventory when you're personally responsible for killing something. I'd like to see the ability to scavenge some meat from naturally-killed wildlife added to the final game; it would provide a useful source of additional meat in the early game, and it could be balanced by providing fewer meat per animal and/or meat of a lower ""freshness"" level than hunting-obtained meat. I haven't had a chance to unlock the butchery skill yet for myself, so I'm not sure exactly what it does, but I'm guessing it currently just unlocks a new building that allows you to process raw meat. Perhaps the final game could expand it by separating killing from harvesting of meat, so that after you kill an animal you have to harvest its carcass like you'd harvest a berry bush (though presumably with a different tool), and your efficiency doing so would be dependent on your butchery skill (although that wouldn't really help with giving an early-game source of meat before players develop hunting; but, there are multiple ways this suggestion could end up getting implemented). Ultimately, this stems mainly from seeing those carcasses lying around (a lot of them, with animals going extinct on their own by the end of day 3 without any human help in the current build) and thinking, in a game so focused on efficient utilization of resources, that it's a terrible shame to let good meat go to waste :)"

Once we have a final release after alpha and beta assuming that we have a digital currency to pair with real world like Bitcoin(BTC) or Teslacoin(TES) Maybe we could provide new players that finish 100% of the credits a bonus on the public server. Obviously this would be a great incentive to new players and possibly help drive noobs to want to pay a fee to get on the list after they missed the alpha and beta. Maybe if the fee was 30-35/alpha with name in credits it could be 3x after final release. We could have the ""credit watching bonus"" generated by in game transaction fees unrelated to license/key fees."

• Chat from server - I know there is a tab for this, currently doesnt do much for me though. Good to have for server resets, timed messages - @pyhfol
• Ingame player list - See who is online from the client, in future could also include some control like kicks/bans perhaps - @pyhfol
• LastOnline <player> command query to see how long ago someone went offline - @Halogen
• TimePlayed command for yourself and TimePlayed <Player> to query others - @Halogen • Player Reset - Delete a player from the server or effectively restart their progress. Handy if a player goofs themselves, loses starting equipment or other. - @Azuroth
• Kick/Mute/TempBan commands - @Halogen • Set Player Spawn - Set a new default player spawn area for worlds that generate the spawn in bad spot - ie the ocean - @delenca
• Delete/Remove ingame items - Often players have issues removing an item or something has bugged. Early on an overall 'remove' function would be very handy - @pyhfol
• AreaRollBack <radius> <time>, resets all blocks in a given radius back to what they were a given time ago, handy for combating trolls and griefers - @Halogen

I thought the purpose of the web interface was so that players could have meaningful interactions with the game (like making and voting for laws as well as buying/selling things) while not being able to be in-game.  Currently it appears that you have to initiate the web interface from within the game.  If this is the intention, I have to wonder why there is a web interface at all?  the same menus and options can be made available from within the game's GUI and it would be much more seamless that way. My preference would be for the web interface, but only if I can initiate change without having to login to the game."

We'll need to create a cross-domain registration."
