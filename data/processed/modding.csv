Since the launch of Eco Mods back in January 2018, we've met many people who weren't satisfied with their current server hosts due to the lack of features or the expensive prices for basically nothing but a standard server in return. That's what we're trying to defeat with our own hosting service for ECO. Features All of this starting from 9.99€ per Month! We're happy to announce that ECO Server Host is the first and only hosting service for ECO that offers an official mod-installer from eco-mods.com! With our exclusive and official bridge between our game-servers and eco-mods.com you’ll be able to install any mod that is available with just a click. No need for us to download mods manually and add them to your server by hand.  Click here to visit our website.  Click here to join our Discord.

modding,ECO Mod/Plugin System Design | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1372/eco-mod-plugin-system-design,8975,7,1,ChronosWS,"Introduction ECO is designed to be both a specific simulation in the short term and a platform for simulations in the long term.  One key feature required for this is a comprehensive and flexible modding system provided as a first-class feature.  Examples of existing mod systems for similar (and I use similar to mean dynamic voxel-style worldbuilding sandboxes) can be found in various stages of development.  See the following: Forge (Minecraft)Space EngineersStarMade When I say 'first class' I mean that modding is integral to the product, intentionally designed and intended for others to build upon it.  Contrast to Forge, which was not designed in to Minecraft and has had to work largely in parallel with and separately from the development of the game itself.  A first-class system should have excellent support, deep ability to alter the product and be well documented and easy to use. A good modding API is also not just something that is useful to third-party developers.  If ECO is a platform and the Mod API is well done, then the game itself can be written largely in terms of mods on top of the fundamental mechanics.  That is an excellent test of the modding system Framing the Problem So we have a platform we wish to mod.  What separates the platform from the mods?  The platform provides the base functionality upon which the mods build.  In ECO, the platform includes such things as: When we speak of the modding system, we are concerning ourselves with the shape of the last bullet point, and ensuring that the other bullet points provide some interface which allows the mod system to alter the behavior of the other aspects of the system. Breaking the problem down The problem space for what mods could do is effectively limited by ones imagination, but to realistically implement a system, we need to break the problem down into smaller, more limited problem spaces.  I'll submit an initial list for consideration: Classes of Mods Each of the above classes will have particular requirements on the API necessary for a mod of that class to be implemented, and this API will differ substantially from the API necessary for mods of other classes.  For example, a Block mod will need to be able to provide information about how it is treated in the world vis-a-vis its interactions with other blocks, where its placement is allowed or not, what happens when it is placed or destroyed, if and how it is part of terrain generation, what state must be maintained with it when saved or transmitted and how it is rendered in a visualization.  An entity mod has some of these features (visualization and state communication for example), but also must be able to control things like movement and interaction with the terrain and other entities as the entity evolves.  As we consider the API, we must consider which behaviors each class would require to implement. Mod Life Cycle Each mod also has a life cycle which the modding system must support.  This means having established startup and shutdown procedures, a mechanism for the mod to save and re-load its state and transmit state to clients if that is necessary.  Mods may require other mods in order to function (such as a simulation which requires specific kinds of blocks) and the system must be able to enforce these requirements. Security Security for mods is a serious concern - a mod author with access to the file system of the host machine can wreak all kinds of havoc.  Implementing appropriate security will depend a lot on deep technical details if the system is to provide this functionality rather than deferring to the judgment of the users.  I recommend leaving this for a separate discussion except inasmuch as it may influence the design of certain APIs.. How do we start One way to make this intellectual exercise into reality is to spitball some mod ideas from each class and implement them.  In some cases, existing behaviors of the system may serve as examples of mods of a given class (like the existing rabbit entity could be an example of an Entity mod, and serve to help define what behaviors that Entity API must expose.)  Community ideas and attempted implementations of mods will serve to refine the API over time and bring it closer to the functionality desired by release.  The more of ECO which is implemented in terms of the mod API, the more likely the API is to be complete and useful to third-party developers. As we go, documentation (even in outline form) needs to make its way to the Wiki for review and use by the community."
modding,ECO Mod/Plugin System Design | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1372/eco-mod-plugin-system-design,8975,7,2,R4mbo,"@ChronosWS said: When it comes to security I also ask myself how deep mods should be able to interact with clients...
UI-Access from Server to Clients would be great. So we can write Server-Mods which for example, implement an health-bar to the clients.
Or a money-value or any other stats-bar. I dont care about the security of server-mods, since I as admin can look into them for my self.
But stuff like passing full scripts from server-mods to the gameclients would be very problematic.
Since players could join a modded server then, which could run code on the client machines to download trojans and stuff or
even transmit local files from client machine to the server or any ip, without any antivirus recognizing it."
modding,ECO Mod/Plugin System Design | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1372/eco-mod-plugin-system-design,8975,7,3,ChronosWS,"@R4mbo said: From the perspective of types of mods which one can write, I think the notion is that you could write a mod package that implemented client features and was distributed from the server, particularly if the mod had both server and client functionality (think a new animal with special behaviors.)  That would include any kinds of visualizations that go along with the mod. Security on the client side is tricky.  At a minimum we will want to notify people of the presence of mods which would be uploaded by the server before they are uploaded and acknowledgment of the risks involved.  From a technical standpoint it would be nice to be able to sandbox the mods, but there are serious limitations on what can be accomplished in the Mono runtime and Unity.  We might be able to do some sort of scanning for disallowed API usage (think file system, process execution.)  All remains to be seen but we are definitely aware of the problems."
modding,ECO Mod/Plugin System Design | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1372/eco-mod-plugin-system-design,8975,7,4,ClayC,"I think the best scenario will be for the client to let you know which mods you want and it offers to either auto download them or get the mods and install them yourself. Mods will then need to have a versioning system to make sure they are running to proper mod with the proper mod version. Security is crucial when it comes to modding a game server and client with auto updates etc. If the game auto sends the scripts, to their clients, the clients will be very vulnerable to any kind of spyware or malware."
modding,ECO Mod/Plugin System Design | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1372/eco-mod-plugin-system-design,8975,7,5,Klaas,Would it be an idea to offer a central modding platform where mods will need to be reviewed and signed? The only problem I would see here is the not very small amount of work in reviewing mods and signing them and then who would be responsible if a security issue hasn't been seen while reviewing the mod?
modding,ECO Mod/Plugin System Design | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/1372/eco-mod-plugin-system-design,8975,7,6,ChronosWS,"@Klaas said: What I would envision is that there are basically three tiers:
""Official Mods""  - Mods which are written by or directly approved by SLG, which are tested and known to have appropriate game balance, etc.
""Certified Mods"" - Mods which have been reviewed by the community (probably open sourced) which a server operator can be reasonably certain are ok to use
""Everything else"" - Anything which doesn't fall into the other two categories."

When I used the blast furnace to process ore, it would say 20 bars are made for 40 ore at max efficiency. However - it still made 20 tailings. So to make use of all of this waste I now introduce Eco Concrete, the product of mixing cement with tailings which, in real life would make the chemicals in tailings inert and safe to use in construction. This is a real life means of handling the waste as making huge caverns underground and living on massive piles of tailings is kinda .. yeah.

modding,Question about simulation details | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/4971/question-about-simulation-details,403,4,1,Sevidra,"So hi. I was thinking about adding some things to the environment (apple trees, peach trees, maybe other crops and such?  Maybe ferrets? lol).  Anyway, prior to even considering something like that, I wanted to learn more about how the simulation is functioning.
I've set up several servers with varying numbers (by altering death, spread, etc rates) of plants and animals. I increased plants a bit to see what would happen, since an addition of trees and berries or crop plants would add to the number of spawning plants.  To compensate, I also increased the rates of the plants that are 'food plants' for animals - waterweed, grass, etc. I've been having a problem with trout and salmon dying out.  Not tuna, just trout and salmon.  laugh  I don't know how this is happening! I tried making Kelp (and clams and urchins even) extra food items for those two fish.  I HAD added them to the food for otters, but took that off in case it was causing their decline.  Nope.  Nothing is helping.  I'm confused. Since there are no other players and no other variables I can find, I'm so lost.  Does anyone have a way to tell what the simulation is actually doing, so maybe I could find out what's going on? Oh, and someone broke the /noah commands - they think /noah 25 is asking for 'trout,25', 'tortoise,25', etc, not 25 of 'trout' and 25 of 'tortoise', etc.  Someone seems to have misplaced a quotation mark in the parser or something. :P Also, spawnanimal doesn't work for trout and salmon - I've tried.

Installation Instructions Author Description
Hello everyone!
After playing Eco for a little while I quick realized the potential this game has for modding. It's much easier and faster than most games to mod, and provides one of the most seamless modded experience around, probably.
Once I decided to have my own server so it could be the home of the group of players I've met and stuck together in-game (GBC), I had to mod it to my leisure. After 4 days of reading, modding, testing and re-testing, with a little push from friends it became obvious that I could publish it to make the lives of others easier, and also to (hopefully) serve as a door to bring vanilla players to the magical world of mods - that's what Minecraft modpacks did to me years ago and after those, every game I really enjoy I end up grabbing all the possible mods for it, and bruteforcing my way into making the ones I want play nice together.
This is a package of curated and compatible (or compatibilized) mods developed by the whole Eco modding community. The GBM
The modpack aims to expand, deepen or add to the vanilla experience, while doing the best to keep the games and servers stable by only adding engrossing, interesting mods that do not overly negatively impact performance or balance - my ultimate goal is to achieve the same as Minecraft modpacks achieved: let people have the mods without worrying about losing hours of gameplay.
As this is an Early Access game, all sorts of problems can happen, but those should be reported to those responsible (report mod issues to their modders, report vanilla and Eco issues to the developers) as to attain the highest quality, best solutions, and less waste of time as possible. Uninstallation
Backup your Mods folder or redownload/Verify Integrity of Game Files for quick uninstall.To uninstall individual mods, you'll first have to take the pill, Neo. Compatibility Notes - Adding mods manually
Ideally you should not overwrite your /Mods folder - use the full one provided by the modpack and if you want to add new mods manually, you must do it on your own time, effort and risk. Due to the high amount of mods, adding new mods could either render one of the mods useless, overwritten or broken - take special care with mods that makes changes to recipes and the tech-tree as not to cut yourself or your players off the game progression or cause unrecoverable unbalances! Hint 1: If you understand you're doing this on your own risk, you can try: Hint 2: An easy way to compatibilize mods is simply using a diff software [e.g. WinMerge], comparing the modpack-provided file/folder vs. the new mod file/folder, and applying the desired changes to each individual file. Assuming the mod is compiled as a .dll, of course. Future Plans
A few dedicated modders are looking forward to making the Eco more and more fun and complex in the long run, if possible.
I'm keeping contact with as many mod authors as I can, and I will try to keep the modlist spreadsheet updated.
I have multiple plans for multiple things regarding Eco. With any luck I will have free time to complete them! More info:GBM Release Video and Mod Highlights Youtube Video

a. I cannot guarantee any compatibility between the modpack and different versions of the game, different versions of the included mods, or compatibility with new mods.
b. I cannot guarantee the full extent of the safety of your savegames or the stability of your game and server. I run the mod pack on my own and friend servers, so I test as much as I can before updating the pack. But the Early Access/Beta nature of the game itself should hint towards the reality of things.
c. I do not work as a modder (although that sounds awesome as a job) and I may not be always available for helping. If you discover an specific issue with a specific mod, you may have more luck contacting the mod author.
d. When running into bugs, make sure you verify, if you can, whether your problem is caused by mods, vanilla or user error before bringing a problem to the wrong table - over 90% of ""mods are breaking the game"" statements I've heard are actually not even closely related to installed mods.
e. Do not redistribute this package as your own - this package include IPs of multiple individuals and should be respected as so.
f. If you want to base your own modpack on GBM, feel free to do so, but like its author, provide credit where it's due.
By downloading and applying this software package you agree with those terms and conditions. Note: I do not change the mod behaviors intended by the authors, but I do reserve the right balance mods or the game as I see fitting for the pack. I'd only rewrite mod code if utmost necessary to guarantee compatibility. If I can't reproduce the same quality or performance as the original author, I'd prefer not to touch a mod and rely on the modder to make the integration/compatibility patch or version instead.

A standalone modpack intended to enhance and empower Server Admins, Owners, Moderators, or players in general. This modpack includes admin commands and tools to enable admins to perform a variety of actions, or facilitates/automates certain process or procedures. Installating Author Description
Hello everyone!
After releasing the GBM Modpack, it became evident not everyone has the need for admin mods.
Given that certain of those can break or become outdated more easily than content mods, I preferred to break them away and offer standalone modpacks with different goals - those will be standalone and mixed and matched as players prefer.
I run the mods on my own server - the Glorious Bean Server - and am constantly on the lookout for good and stable mods to package and present more easily to the community in general. The GBM and the GBSU
The modpack aims to expand, deepen or add to the vanilla experience, while doing the best to keep the games and servers stable by only adding engrossing, interesting mods that do not overly negatively impact performance or balance - my ultimate goal is to achieve the same as Minecraft modpacks achieved: let people have the mods without worrying about losing hours of gameplay. As this is an Early Access game, all sorts of problems can happen, but those should be reported to those responsible (report mod issues to their modders, report vanilla and Eco issues to the developers) as to attain the highest quality, best solutions, and less waste of time as possible. The GBSU follows the same ideas, focused on server owners, admins or players looking for more tools and commands. Uninstallation Compatibility Notes
Given that mods in the GBSU are standalone 'tools' and usually don't overwrite vanilla files, compatibility between the pack and other mods is almost guaranteed.
For similar mods, make sure to check their mods pages for known compatibility issues, as I can't keep track of every little integration and compatibility detail at all times. Future Plans
There's a couple things I still want to expand with the GBM.. :)
Plans include adding more awesome and stable mods, and making it easier to install & customize the pack(s).
I'm keeping contact with as many mod authors as I can, and I will try to keep the modlist spreadsheet updated.
I have multiple plans for multiple things regarding Eco. With any luck I will have free time to complete them! Disclaimer

How to UseLeft clicking on the X or the barrel will throw your selected item away.Warning! Your item will not be recoverable, it is gone forever once it is throw in the barrel.Right clicking the barrel will open a dialog telling you how much weight is currently in the barrel.Right clicking the X will attempt to pick up the barrel, if you have enough space in your inventory and there is no trash in the barrel.E opens the item normally like any other item in Eco, you can check the status, and add to the fuel storage here. You can not turn the barrel on or off, if it has fuel and garbage it will automatically burn. The air pollution is equal to half of the Excavator (.1 ppm per hour). Features
Get rid of unwanted items
Burn stacks of items at a time if they fit
Detailed pollution statistics similar to the Excavator
Pollution effects
Custom, randomized ember, light, and fire particle effects
Only 75 particles per second total
""Overstuff"" barrel by 1 item, stuff that trash full! Source Code
Please feel free to study / modify / use the code I created, it is lightly commented.https://pastebin.com/HDQtPf17 ​ Known Issues
There are no known issues. ChangelogV1.2
Added the 'Auth' tab (you will only see this tab if you place the barrel on claimed property.)
Updated if the item you throw away has 0 weight, it will add 10% weight to the barrel. V1.1
Updated textures to all be curved, so they do not appear floating from a distance.
Updated particles to look better with the new shaders.
Made X button selectable through the barrel, so you do not have to hop on top to pick it up if it is placed in a corner.
Removed a few unneeded dependencies from the C# script."

DumpDlls is a mod that pulls the modding API Dlls from an Eco server when the server is launched. There is no command or other action you need to do to run the mod, just have it installed. (Though keep in mind that the mod will run every time the server is launched. So uninstalling the mod after you've run it once is recommended.) The mod will pull the following dlls from the server and drop them into the server's root folder: These API dlls can be included in a Visual Studio C# project and used to make Eco mods. You will need to move the dlls to another folder after they are pulled from the server, otherwise the server will have errors the next time it launches. I am also creating a blank C# project for Visual Studio. This C# project comes with a copy of the Eco modding API Dlls. You will need to add the API Dlls as references inside of this or any other C# project to have them be usable inside the project's code. Download links for both the DumpDlls mod and the blank C# project can be found on this page of my website.

Also, i would like to tweak some things but in this current format it's impossible, are you planning to make at least the ""home"" part with normal .cs files so it's possible to edit them like it was on earlier versions ?
For example i would like the chest to not accept block carriable objects, and disable weight limit, i saw on earlier version it was commented. any way to uncomment that line from the dll ?"

But what else? once i have positioned the object what should i do with that cube ? obviuosly i don't leave it enabled, but also if i disable it it's not good too, because i still see it when placing object ingame and if the object it smaller than the cube i don't see it (i see throu it while placing only if i put materials as ""mobile/diffuse"", with mobile/diffuse i do not get a border preview while placing but a full rendered object).
Actually i delete the component, but i'm sure that it's not the right way, maybe it has something to do with occupancy ? should i replace it with the rendered object itself or something like that? 2 - another cube question, how should i do when i have to place an object that is 2 block larger? because if i want to be able to put them serially i should set the cube on the left, or right, not the center, else maybe do i have to change it to a 2 block cube ? and when i change it do i lose the offset for ingame block ? 3 - what about occupancy? how do i avoid different object the be intersected? are we talking about the same cube again ? 4- as opposite as occupancy is it possible to place multiple items on the same block? let's say i have a little statue to put on the table and also a wall shelf to put on the same block, is there a way to have 0 occupancy for a selected object ? 5 - What i have to do to get object volume calculated inside rooms? because right now if i put an object that uses 45mcube those meters are not counted on the room tooltip, it says 0 meters occupied. 6 - How to a set a table surface as a real surface? actually to put something over a table i need a wall near as the table surface is not recognized so you need the wall to enable the block over the table, are we still talking about that white cube ? :) 7 - i have a problem with object highlight, on some objects when i go near to them the green highlight that should be only on edges will paint the entire object and it becomes full green cryptonite, how do i avoid this ? thank you for any suggestion!!"

Then we need to pass Info between Users and the Server and execute the teleport commands. I will refer to the Teleport and MOTD Mods I did before, where most neccesary code is already used.

Couldn't even serialize Vector3.
Look's like it's declared at Eco.Shared.Math and I don't know if it's even possible for modders to create custom structs which are serializable. Whatever. I got it working. But there is one major Problem:
Every User can create warps.
I wanted to restrict it on admins only, but I didn't find a way to check if a User is Admin or not with the newer Version of Eco. You can see how I tried at the script. ToDo:
Warp creation for Admins only
Delete Warps via Command
Bug-Fixing Current Usage:
/wadd WARPNAME (this will create a Warp at the current Player-Position)
/w WARPNAME (this will teleport the Player to Warp WARPNAME) For every Warp a .r4 File will be created in the ""Warps""-Directory.
It can be just deleted by Server-Owners. Download:Warps.cs

since this was private use I didn't see the need for it at the start. The app also has a option to convert the domain to IP as I been having big problems and so have so many others with domain names in the
app, but when it's using it's IP it's 100% fine so all I can see is it's failing to convert domain to IP in the game client, so as a not recommended option we also include a IP converter(convert domain to IP) Is this something others will be interested in? if so please reply and I will look in to making it public, at the moment it's still very basic and in places broken as I been lazy lol but I am working on it."

Also this is made very clear it's also made for the Continue play, without ever having to even open the server list and get lag and crashing on hi end systems that server list can lock up and crash's the game, this are facts given to me by my players, streamers we have watched and myself I seen it first hand happen one 3 systems all happing around the same time. It's just a little tool to know it's already there, it also removed the wonder did the game save that fav or not, as not all the time it does.
it's just a ease of access app nothing more nothing less. And I found that the game does not always convert domains to IP sometimes so it returns server offline when this is fault so to
test this the tool can convert and save the continue file for you with the IP to 100% make sure the IP is right."

Another future use for this tool is a launcher for lazy users they can have there server already to play without ever using the server list, they would just add it to the launcher and very time they click play it would add there server at the time to there continue, it could also create a shortcut so no app is seen it does the changes on the fly so there fav server is a icon away rather then a few clicks away lol Yes that is big problem here, sorry but many of you see it that way as you don't have the issues so you look at it the wrong way or think that the user is doing it wrong, I respect your work and view but remember some of us spend hrs if not days or even weeks debuggy things as well as yourself :)"

The mod focusses on giving nonCooperation servers a faster way to establish
the economy by reducing some of the walls you encounter while playing on your own. The focus is on getting currencies, stores, all you need to enable trading out faster. Also some stuff makes no sense so I changed that... Installation Note: This Mod conflicts with mods that  changed contents of AutoGen Folder. Patch Notes: -Gold Ingot
stays at 4000 Weight which equals to 12.4 kg or 74.4 Kg for 6 Ingots. -Iron Ingot
has been changed to 1600, since Gold is 2.45 times denser than Iron. -Copper Ingot
has been changed to 1700, since Copper is a little denser than Iron. -Gold Tailings
have been reduced to 1 Since the gold tailing solid/Liquid Ratio is 40:60 and 1MT of mined Ore generates 2.49 MT of Tailing. -Iron Tailings
have been reduced to 1 to match the cleaner processing and reflect the re-processing of iron tailing (e.g.cement) -Copper Tailings
have been increased to 3 to match the 90-98% generated tailing from processing copper ore. -Store
Requirements reduced to Basic Crafting Skill 1 to encourage early trading. -Anvil
Room Requirements have been removed, it's a fucking Anvil. -Mint
*crafting recipe changed to 60 Iron Ingots, try to make metal coins in a wood press
*room requirements changed to Tier 1, currency needs to be there early to get trade going -Small Wood Cart
*Storage buffed to 12 & 1500000
*speed increased on all road types -Wood Cart
*Storage buffed to 20& 2000000
*speed increased on all road types -Powered Cart
*Storage buffed to 24 & 4000000

Now if I can find out how to set myself as admin in solo play things would be perfect. Kind of messed up that when you create your own solo game it doesn't auto set the owner of it to admin. Just user. 0.o  I'll re-download the server package from the eco site and hope that that will still work maybe? I didn't want to cross files if it would mess up the game though.

They actually fixed a LOT of GREAT things.. Like... you are now auto admin on solo map creations.. gee.. wouldn't that have been nice to have known about... well.. a day or two ago lol.  and they 'greatly decreased the skill requirements' thank god! That was ridiculous.
So... thanks for the help, but it looks like the trouble was for nothing. Didn't have to worry about it after all I guess...  But yes to turn off meteor still.. I was amazed when I read that it doesn't destroy the world now! It makes craters and drops the world temp and emits radiation but doesn't destroy it... even with the meteor running, that might be interesting to play out and see how it goes.. Hopefully the radiation and eco system will restore itself after a time. So thanks and happy gaming!"

modding,AdminUtils v3.0.0 for Beta 0.7.0.8: Introducing configurable permissions! | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3446/adminutils-v3-0-0-for-beta-0-7-0-8-introducing-configurable-permissions,1496,1,1,Pradoxzon,"This update brings a huge addition to the mod: a configurable Permissions System. This new system allows admins to control which users can have access to which commands through the use of user groups. If you have ever wanted to have a moderator level for users, now you can!
AdminUtils replaces the default command processing logic, so it determines if a user can run a command. This has no lasting effects on the server. If AdminUtils is uninstalled, the server will go back to determining if a user can run a command without any side effects. The system is fully configurable, allowing admins to set up any number of groups for their users. Each group can be set to have access to any command, and can also inherit from another group. Inheritance allows a group to use any commands that are available to the groups it inherits from without having to have those commands manually added. The system adds a config file to ""Configs/AdminUtils"" called ""Permissions.eco"". This config file controls the groups and which user belongs to which group. It uses the same format as the other .eco config files, and can be edited manually. Permissions.eco expects the same userID to represent a user as would be used in the default config files. The install .zip file of AdminUtils does not come with a config file; the mod will generate one when the server is first run. If the config file is edited manually, the command ""/perm-reload"" can be run from in-game to reload the Permissions System without having to restart the server. The commands ""/group"" and ""/user"" control groups and users respectively.
""/group"" allows groups to be created from in game, can display all of the commands available to a group, can display or change the inheritance of a group, and allows for adding and removing of commands from a group.
""/user"" can display which group a user belongs to if any, and can assign or remove a user to or from a group. A more detailed guide on how the Permissions System works, and how to use its commands, is available here. The license that comes with any download of AdminUtils can also be found here on my website. By downloading or installing my mods, you are agreeing to the license. AdminUtils version 3.0.0 can be downloaded here. For more details, see the mod's page on my website.
Added a configurable Permissions System.

With this update: 'Administration' has been renamed to 'AdminUtils', a bunch of new commands were added, a license for using my mods was added, and the back end of the mod received a major overhaul.
Along with this, I'm introducing a new mod: AdminUtilsSolo. This is a stripped down version of my AdminUtils mod tailored for people playing on Solo. AdminUtils will be the permanent name for the Administration mod moving forward. With ideas for future content, I felt that this name was more appropriate. Part of those ideas for future expansion means that the download for my mods come with 2 dll files (the main mod and my 'Core' mod). My Core mod contains code that is shared by all of my mods, so it needs to be installed with them in order for my mods to function properly.

Thanks to all from Whovania who have given me ideas, feedback and such! Please note. This version will only work if you do a clean install of a server. That means only newly created worlds will work. To install it, you must delete the whole server folder. Reinstall the server THEN unzip my mods on top of the Mod folder. DO NOT INSTALL this on old worlds! Here is what is all in this bad boy! Allow Players to carry items 20 at a time! Fixed Weight of Carried Dirt, Ore, and Sand! Allow Players to stack items up to 20, instead of 10, in a cart type vehicle. Fish Tacos are BACK! (still working on a nice balance for my old foods!) Slightly better than Elk Taco, but do not eat a lot, you could get.. well... you'll see.... Recycler: New Profession.
Has Basic Recycling, Recycling, and Advance Recycling.
as well as Recycling Efficiency and speed for all 3. Fix world Items from clashing with other world items for hurting your skill points!(Old way: Add a bed (1 point) and a small rug(.75 points thanks to bed) in one room. The new way: You get one point for each now, and get hit with .75 if you add either another bed or small rug) Two new Tables: Recycling Table(Needs 300 mechanical power)
Recycling Plant(Needs 2500 electrical power) Tool Upgrade! You can now upgrade old tools to newer better one! Stone/Wood to Iron, Iron to Steel, Steel to Modern! Made on a Recycling Table and/or Recycling Plant! Bigger Storage chest! Needs Lumber and Iron ingots! Shovels now can pick up 20 at a time from carts/Stockpiles! The stove is NOW made on an Anvil! Fixed: Coal is now as light as the ores, dirt, etc! Changed: Stove NOW need Steel to be made(Really? Logs still??? :P) Added: Solar Panels. Use the POWER OF THE SUN to power your Grid. Beware! This will cause Increased CO2 to be made, and only gives a small amount of power(100) You will need to build a Solar Farm if you want to turn your house/city Green!!! Needs Advance Recycling, and build on the Recycling Plant. Power Carts NOW use Biodiesel! Corn Ethanol: A new fuel made from Corn and Gasoline, at the Recycling Plant. Better than Biodiesel! Small Fix: Small and normal size carts have increased the amount of weight they can hold! Both wooden carts move a little better on Asphalt roads. Power Carts move a lot better on Asphalt roads, but even worse on Dirt roads. New Recycling recipes: Turn old workbenches back into logs
Turn old campfire back into stones
Turn wood pulp into boards"

Its really wonderful to be able to have the server ui console commands now available in game, especially being able to save the game before shutting it down.  This command is helpful even for those that have  the console access.  We  have wanted this for our server owners for some time and with the SLG busy getting ready for steam launch it was not something that John thought they could not get to for a while so suggested we see if someone could make a mod.  Pradoxzon was willing to work on this so this has been really great! We want Pradoxzon to know how much we appreciate his work on this and that the credit for this work goes solely to him.

For example, if you make someone an admin, saving makes sure they are still admin after a restart. (Without saving the server might not remember that they are an admin.) It functions the exact same as the ‘save’ button on the console.
The /backup command triggers a manual backup of the world. This is the same backup that is performed by scheduled backups."
modding,Administration v1.0.0 for ECO Alpha 0.6.4.1 is released! | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/3271/administration-v1-0-0-for-eco-alpha-0-6-4-1-is-released,1894,5,5,rentechd,"/save is an important command, even if you have access to the ui console, as often you want to force a save before the server is stopped.   If you are using a hosting service it totally depends on how they have things configured and set up as to where a save is done when you click a 'stop' or 'restart command'.  If they don't have command scripts that run before the shutdown is executed that send the command to save you could risk losing back to the last auto save the game did.  This has been an issue for some server admin with hosted servers.  Now they have a way to send a save command before they live the game and click the stop clink/button in they game control panel.  The most they will lose at that point would be the time between when they issue that command and when they clicked stop.  For those with hosts that already send a save command to the server before sending the shutdown command, this really is not that important but its nice to have in other cases.  If for some reason you server started acting up and lagging very badly or showing other errors, being able to tell it to save from in the game in case its thinking about crashing is always helpful.  This is the same command that is run by what you set in the Storage.eco for saving the game. the /backup command is what is run by the configuration you have set in the Backup.eco which backups your Game.eco, the db files and makes a backup file in the Storage./Backups/.   You will have set how many backups to retain, say 10 for example, but if you to a /backup from in game you will see an extra backup in the Storage/Backup folder unless the next time autobackup runs, and removes the files that exceed the number you said to save - but its a way to know the command is working."

And yes, Burning them causes MAJOR CO2 just to get rid of them. To this day, there are some companies who reduce Tailings by multiple ways from heating it with other types of Tailings to fuse them, or even using them to build roads! They are even mixing dirt and other stuff to create a re-vegetation technique! There are many companies to this day that uses a coking-style way of dealing with tailing. They 'cook' it up with X items(depends on which types of Tailings, as each type of mineable item creates its own version of tailings.  This is one of many approaches being pursued to reduce the volume of mature fine tailings. MY way, however, will cause 3 hours of non-stop CO2 pollution, as well as you using up over 40 coal. Once CO2 starts working again players will have to choose do they want to cut down the number of tailings they have and waste a lot of fuel and time on it or keep it status quo. Way back in 5.4, I research what I could about this topic to find ways of reducing Tailings. I am sure I could have added Sand and Oil(Petroleum) to the recipe to make it more 'real world', but I felt like I 'punished' the player with the major increase of time needed to reduce tailings. If anyone wants to learn more about what humans do with leftover tailings, here is a website of one of the many companies that research, and try to deal with this problem. http://www.cosia.ca/initiatives/tailings/tailings-projects"

It's on a private localhost so the server is restarted between every single update I make to check for errors. Could it be that if I teleport to home 1 it teleports me to coordinate 1? Here's what I've tried + results: /home 1 - Teleports me to complete darkness and if I do /unstuck I might end up on the other side of the world/home 2  - Same thing/home e - Makes me fall from the sky to the correct position (but I would land on the roof if there was one)/home ekke - Same thing/home abc - Infinite fall loop

Stockpiles have majorly changed by now taking into the account to divide the stack by 5(height of the stockpile) so, 1 log can go 5 high and ores can go 5 high if you place 20 of them down, which is why ores can be stack 20 and everything else is 5.

What I did is I used the efficiency to modify the pumping speed instead of the number of petroleum gotten (crafting speed skill still apply).
And made it so you get 1:1 barrel:petroleum at the refinery. The efficiency still affects gasoline epoxy and plastic. ECO-Barrel_multiplication_fix_0.01.zip"

All the values look solid in the UI, but once crafted you are still getting the same additional barrels at the refinery at most efficiencies. Because the values are rounded up for every unit crafted, not for the whole batch. So, sorry for the false hope :/"

modding,Mog's Mods | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2791/mog-s-mods,1221,2,2,Mog,"SoftEfficiency: A mod that reduces the impact of the efficiency skills. With this mod, you now are much more efficient from the start. And efficiency 5 gives you ""only"" twice as much output than efficiency 0. It solves several problems I have with vanilla: I have mostly modified the efficiency skill files, trying to to touch the other files to much for mod compatibility. That's why you have some efficiency % from the start. But did my best to give round values at the crafting tables. I hade to make up 6 tiers of efficiency so not all could be multiples of 10. Enter a big value when you're crafting and you can figure out the ratios from there (try 100, 40, 70..). Feel free to let me know what you think of it. I've been testing it on Miisa's server ([EU]Friendly Ecoplay [2]..) It's not super crowded so I'm still curious of people's opinions. (Feel free to join the server BTW. Miisa's servers are really good and she is always around to resolve any problem.)ECO-SoftEfficiency_Full_pack_003.zip : This file contains SoftEfficiency and some small mods that adds up nicely to it. It is the file I recommend you use.
To install just drag and drop the Mods folder into your Eco server folder, and replace all. Restart the server for the changes to take effect. (Turn it off and on again) The separated mods contained in the pack: ECO-SoftEfficiency_001.zip . ECO-Barrel_multiplication_fix_003.zip : You don't lose or multiply barrels in the process of pumping/refining oil anymore. Not fully compatible with vanilla. ECO-Biodiesel_simple_rework_001.zip : Biodiesel is now usable in carts and generators. Biodiesel now takes kitchen oil to craft and is more expensive (it's extremely cheap in the base game) ECO-DritBricks_001.zip : Bricks are now crafted out of dirt. As simple as that."

modding,Message-Plugin Version 0.2 | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/824/message-plugin-version-0-2,3355,8,1,The Doctor,"Thanks to @Metachronism, I was able to create a mod/Plugin that sends a message to the server every nth minute. I did not use the EcoModKit to create this. I based it off AdminChatCommands.cs. Also as this place is for discussion of modding, if this is not the correct place to post plugins/mods, please move it to the right forum section. What is it?
This is a small plugin that will auto send a message to your server every nth minute. You are able to change the time and message (as of Version 0.1) in MOTD.cs file on line 15 (for time) and line 14 for the message. Version 0.2 will include changing of the file time and message via commands. This plugin can be used to inform people what your team speak or discord channel is. It can also be used for a motd to be sent out every so often to remind people about things. The possibilities are endless. Please note that time is in milliseconds. 300000 ms = 5 minutes. So every 5 minutes the message is sent to everyone connected to your server. Features of Version 0.1: How to install and Use:
Download attached file. Place MOTD.cs into  the server folder/Mods/Misc. Once placed in the Misc folder restart server. This will enable the mod and compile it. Make sure you are flagged as an admin via the server. If you are not an admin the command will not work. Once flagged as an admin type /motd-on to enable the message. to disable it type /motd-off. The method of how to start and stop is not set in stone and could eventually change. Download MOTD.cs - Version 0.2 @R4mbo Version - R4mbo Version (Check out his post about his version) Known Issues:
None: Features to come: Thanks again to the following who helped me out throughout the process of making this small plugin.
Metachronism@NoBlackThunder - for helping with the known error."

Version 0.3 is coming a long nice. I've added in support for loading messages via txt file along with them getting rotated ever 5 minutes or so. (I forgot what the default time span I've set.). With Version 0.3 the commands have changed again. I'm also working on creating config xml file instead of a txt document so it can also hold the amount of time to pass before the next message is sent in the queue. This is no longer a MOTD mod. This is more of a random message mod now. The Doctor

In the Manage your servers page you should find the api key for the server you are setting up, copy it,
Now from the ClaysToolKit folder in Mods on your server files open claystk-vote.cs, find the line where it says ServerAPI and where there is """" paste your key between the double quotes. save and load up the server.

That's a good suggestion indeed, for future teleport update's.
I do want to bring another problem to attention that is part of the vanilla game, That gives you the same problem on a even worse scale.
When people teleport to you, Toxxikz the can get in your house and taken items from unlocked chest and workbenches.
But currently when people login and out of the game it takes a x amount of time to load all world object for example doors,
And if a person relogs the doors are gone for a few moment and the can walk in and out of your house/base that way even when your offline, so even if clay improves on his teleport, the base vanilla game need a serious improvement in the future on this issue,"

Although what I can do is add a mod that they can do /daily or something like that which gives them the daily rewards. that should be very easy to implement but it's yet another command xD @toxxikz to be honest what the devs can do is load the world properly. at the moment I see a loading world in the loading screen and when the game loads the world was not loaded, so what is happening during that time? The time spent in loading screen should load everything, from the UI, world and the chunks around you. when the game loads you should see everything loaded. This will also remove any issues we have bypassing doors etc. As for the Teleport mod I think I will just convert it with the Teleport Request and Teleport Accept. This way no one can hop from one place to another and no one will be able to annoy people.

I liked the fact that you added a ""recycle"" skill and hoped that would be the beginning or an expanded tree that would eventually take care of things like tailings.  Recycling is never a one step process if you study it.  You don't turn a plastic bottle directly into something else .  Its a multi-step process that requires multiple different machines to break down in component parts and then taking those parts and putting them back into traditional methods of manufacter or  then taking what the recycle process creates - a new type of resource and using it..  That, of course, would mean adding new objects that can break down these items and in turn that would  produce some traditional as well some new components.  Then you would need objects that would take these new components and either further break them down or make them into new things.  Something like tailing could and should be something that can be recycled but the method would need to be complex and even then still result in some 'left overs'.  Mining tailings, say from gold mining,  in the modern world are now run through sifters and processors to look for gold that was previously missed and other types of minerals that  can be used in other production - just doing this reduces the amount of tailings left behind.   It does not get rid of them completely but does reduce the pile."

Almost all of them want the Mod on their server. Were you told that it would be useless in 5.6 by the ECO Dev's because they plan something similar or are implementing multiple sized chests or something?  The only reason I would see this becoming ""useless"" is if it, or something like it, were being incorporated into the game ;)"

Moving away from chest, and that stockpiles are planned for 5.6 with a polish of the whole building/roomreqs system. OK... So I got Big Storage Chest to work in 5.1 and so I was like.. is it really the biggest? So I made a BIGGER Storage Chest as well! However, for some off reasons, The UI Tooltip for Storage is screwed up(Shows up as code) I removed Bigger and it works.. put Bigger back and it is broke. SO... For those that don't care about the way the tooltip looks like for Storage, I have BIGGER Storage Chest for you.. otherwise if you are a purest, then I got just Big Storage Chest. Big Storage Chest<Outdated> (Place this file in \mod\Items) Bigger Storage Chest:<Outdated>  (Place Bigstoragechestitem.cs and Biggerstoragechestitem.cs in \mod\Item and Storagechestobject.cs in \mod\objects) BTW: Big Chest is 10 Lumber on the Carpentry Table Need level 2 Storage Slots: 32 Bigger Chest is 10 Lumber, 5 Copper, 5 Iron on the Carpentry Table Need level 3 Storage Slots: 64

modding,Mod idea | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2173/mod-idea,3868,19,14,Auzze,"""Terrible Idea"" you say. The idea was offered up as an IDEA, if someone wishes to make the mod and then server owner add it to the server is up to them.
Offering ""skill points' was only one of many thing that could be offered, clothes, food, tables, as well as mats. (Offering a few skillpoints is not game changing) If you look at most other game server who use this type of list use an incentive to get traffic to their server. Is this a bad this NO. More triffic, more players, more fun building a great community. I darn suggest a startingINV mod where you could give new members a few food items to start them off."

For some late game its like 1 skill upgrade... i wouldnt call that game breaking or skewing of anything. There is nothing stopping server owners right now from offering free in game skill points for upvotes. i do like the I voted pin, maybe a special Sign like a campaign sign they can put in front of their house :D"

modding,Mod idea | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/2173/mod-idea,3868,19,17,Nes,"Sorry I was a bit harsh, but you should be able to see my worry. Basically what Mgrand said: Individual servers can take care of balancing on their own with mods, etc. Nothing wrong with that. The problem is when voting becomes something that players feel like they need to do every day to get that extra edge. Any free resources or skill points for such little effort will surely be taken advantage of. That's the whole point, I guess. As I said above I would never do this on my server, because I think all players should be on a level playing field and shouldn't be boosted by activities on a third-party website. Yes, I have asked players on my server to vote from time-to-time. Perhaps I'm misunderstanding the ranking algorithm from that website, but it seems to be pretty heavily determined by votes as long as the server has good uptime and pop.

Being any combination and amount of the following: However we can also make it so that the user collect tokens, and when they have a certain amount of tokens, they can then redeem anything they so desire.
This will make it so that the players need to vote multiple times to get a Skill Point but it's not only that, they can also choose to get an upgraded tool or some building materials. With proper token cost we can also avoid higher tier items from being redeemed very early in the game. With this in mind, imagine that server admins can easily set from day 1 that players can redeem skill points for tokens, but on day 2 they can also redeem wood, lumber, etc etc for tokens. and on day 6 we enable kiln, and other workbenches.
With a server wipe every few weeks the maximum points you can get is 1 per 12hrs (or 24hrs depending on how it's set on ecoserver.io).so with a server wipe happening every 4weeks, you can accumulate a maximum of 56 tokens. Please let me know if you like this idea, if so I would be implementing it also with ClaysTK. I already have a base for this mod to function. Regards

As for the config files like network.eco, user.eco and disaster.eco we have a tool that interfaces with those files so that everything that a user can configure without it being a security issue they are able to.  For example the network.eco is not something we give full access to because the user could accidently change port/IP and then conflict with another server.  However - our tool allows them to interface with that file and edit everything else themselves and not have to wait for support to do it.  If there was a configuration option needed for a popular mod that we had user demand for and we decided to support we would just add that option to the tool."

when a player get the bug, it doesent show a error thats is correct, but a player knows that its going on. so the player should contacht a admin on the server if the have the mod installed. and ask them to typ /tpo (playername capital sensetive) and perform the command when the player is offline/not atempting to login. then the mod will teleport the bugged player to default world spawn location. but the only way to make it work is to have a form of contact with a server admin on the server where the buged happend, so email/skype/teamspeak/ discord/..... The reason the console is not geting a bug is that, when the bug happens a player is at location -x2........ z-2x...., and y-2x..... meaning the player fell of the world. and when trying to log back in the server cant get the player back online cause it doesen know how to load the area. if the admin/players have problems making the mod work correctly the can contact me at discord: https://discord.me/rgcommunity

Since you lost the whole server save file, why not make use of the back-up system that is build in the eco server. By default the eco server setings make a back-up every 30minits and keeps 5 back-ups you can adjust it to more or less save intervalts and more or less back-ups kept depending on your diskspace availible, if the host is not always 100% reliable, Copy the last back-up to another location online or on your local pc. If you dont know how it works here is a short explanation/example.
Default server map structure: \EcoServer_v0.5.4-alpha\Storage\Backup
Copy the last newest file in backup to another save location, local or online, (example file name : 02-22-2017-12.37.40.eco)
To restore your server from the back-up file. Copy the back-up file to,
\EcoServer_v0.5.4-alpha\Storage And rename the file to: Game.eco Your server save file is restored, even after wiping a server just make sure to have a back-up file stored and keep it up to date. Greetings Zaskersky,"

Replace WoodSignObject.cs in Server/Mods/Objects Usage:
If a sign has text that reads: [Teleport] x,y,z or [T] and has coordinates of the form x,y,z in the sign (see example below)
then any player who right clicks that sign will be teleported to the coordinates x,y,z. Note that this is case-sensitive and the space is required between the end bracket and the first coordinate. Examples:
[Teleport] 221,46,943
or
[T] 0,50,0
or
[T]o The Mines!  76,29,392 Important Info:
If the Creator left clicks on the sign, they can still edit it as normal. Right clicks on signs that are not teleports will act as normal. Downloads:WoodSignObject.cs Edit:
Now requires permission in the area you are trying to teleport to. Also fixed crashing on blank signs. Now ignores other text. Credits:

This package is meant to rebalance the tech system in Eco by greatly lowering the cost of every skill, as well slowing their rise in cost per-upgrade. This makes the game easier as you spend less time waiting on skill points and can diversify your skills a lot better than with the default values. This should allow small groups to progress in the game far faster than previously allowed, as you're essentially guaranteed
a skill level up each day, even multiple depending on where you're putting your points. What I've done: Download:Tech.zip"

modding,Starting Simple (I hope) | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/822/starting-simple-i-hope,4035,11,1,The Doctor,"One of the main reason I picked up this game was for the modding, especially since it is in Unity/C# and not in Java like Minecraft... I hate Java..... Figure I would start off with a simple mod. Which would be a MOTD that executes every nth minute. I followed the guide to set up the EcoModKit in Unity. My question now is after I right click and add Item where do I go. As the tutorial is for adding an actual item. I just want to use the chat messages found at the Chat Message Page Though it doesn't really give an example on what I would have to import. Also when I look at  Custom-Chat-Commands Page it shows a few things to import. So I imported them, though when I did Mono Develop shows them as not being found. Is this an issue with not having any of the game dll located in the EcoModKit and will it work once inside the /Mod/ folder of my server? Got the idea from here. Though since it doesn't seam to be any other information about it I've gotten stuck. My goal is when the Start() method is called from script I'm working on, I'll start a timer and during the Update() call if timer is greater than pre determined time then send out the chat message to everyone."

You can modify a lot as a good portion of the game logic is there.  We have plans to further extent modding to more easily support adding what you describe which is more of a plugin. If you have dev tier access of course, there is full source so you can somewhat easily do what you describe."

modding,Starting Simple (I hope) | ECO Forum,https://ecoforum.strangeloopgames.com/topic/822/starting-simple-i-hope,4035,11,4,Metachronism,"To save you some time: Client side modding is broken at the moment (adding art for new objects/icons/etc) - hence a lot of the modkit docs being out of date.  The basic process will probably be similar however (making an asset bundle within unity, then placing that within your server exported mods folder). Server side you can freely add new items, change whats there, go to town.  This is all done by modifying files in the Mods folder, which are compiled at run-time when you launch the server.  There isn't a whole lot of documentation, but feel free to ask away and I can try to help as best as possible."

As I can't seem to find anything on sending a message in the mods folder yet. Though I am still looking. Maybe in a few months when I have some more cash saved up, I'll get the Dev Tier and be able to figure it out a lot faster. Though I still want to try. EDIT: Found the send chat method for a player.
